A carbon source material obtained by thermal decomposition of the hydrocarbon gas subjected to denitrification on a base material in a vacuum chamber, for example, at a temperature not lower than 1200°C and not higher than 2300°C is prepared (S2), diamond is synthesized from the carbon source material, and a seed crystal is cut from the diamond (S3). While this seed crystal is accommodated in a cell together with a solvent and a carbon source, single-crystal diamond is grown from the seed crystal with a high-temperature and high-pressure synthesis method (S4).";"EP";1;2;"12828541";"0925-9635"

Nanoparticles are formed at temperatures as low as 200°C. The nanoparticles may be thermally annealed for a certain amount of time at a temperature lower than the reaction temperature (usually ~40°C lower) to improve the topology and narrow the size distribution. After the reaction is complete, the nanoparticles may be isolated by the addition of a non-solvent and re-dispersed in organic solvents including toluene, chloroform and hexane to form a nanoparticle ink. Additives may be incorporated in the reaction solution to tailor the final ink viscosity.";"WO";1;5;"IB2014/000827";"1687-806X"

[Solution] A diamond semiconductor device of the invention includes: a diamond substrate; a diamond step section disposed over substrate surface of the diamond substrate having a {001} crystal face to rise substantially perpendicularly to substrate surface; an n-type phosphorus-doped diamond region; and a diamond insulation region. In the diamond step section, a first step section having a {110} crystal face over a side surface is integrated with a second step section having a {100} crystal face over a side surface. The phosphorus-doped diamond region is formed by crystal growth started from base angle of the step shape of the first step section over the side surface of the first step section and substrate surface of the diamond substrate as growth base planes. The diamond insulation region is formed by crystal growth over the side surface of the second step section and substrate surface of the diamond substrate as growth base planes.";"EP";1;7;"13879581";"1882-0778"

The method is characterized in that a thin semiconductor film is applied to the foreign substrate in a first step. Then the foreign substrate is heated to such an extent that the semiconductor thin film melts. Then the temperature is slowly decreased to below the melting temperature of the semiconductor material. During the cooling process, the foreign substrate is heated in such a way that, proceeding from the surface of the foreign substrate, the temperature continuously decreases in a vertical direction perpendicular through the semiconductor thin film to the surface of the thin film. It is thereby ensured that the thin film crystallizes, or rather solidifies, in the opposite direction during the slow decrease of the temperature to below the melting temperature of the semiconductor thin film. In other words, the atom layers directly at the exposed surface of the thin film crystallize first, then the next deeper atom layers crystallize, etc., until finally the atom layers in the immediate vicinity of the surface of the foreign substrate crystallize. The atom layers directly at the exposed surface of the thin film can freely orient themselves without interference during the crystallization, whereby the formation of extensive single crystals several atom layers thick is promoted. Said extensive single crystals are then used as growth nuclei for the next deeper atom layers in such a way that said extensive single crystals grow in thickness in the direction of the surface of the foreign substrate. Only the atom layers in the immediate vicinity of the surface of the foreign substrate are interfered with during the crystallization and degrade into an amorphous or polycrystalline boundary layer. In order to ensure the aforementioned temperature course perpendicular through the thin film, either a heat source applied to the underside of the foreign substrate in a planar manner or heating of the foreign substrate by means of electric current passage must be selected as the heating type. The method is suitable in particular for producing highly efficient thin film solar cells.

Contaminants, such as organic matter and metal, on a surface of a Si substrate were removed by subjecting the Si substrate sequentially to organic washing, acid washing and alkaline washing, whereby a flat oxide film (not shown) was formed (S31). The oxide film on the surface was removed by using an aqueous hydrogen fluoride solution having a concentration of 1.0% by weight, whereby hydrogen termination treatment was performed (S32). The Si substrate immediately after being subjected to the hydrogen termination treatment was placed in a vacuum apparatus, and then the temperature of the Si substrate was raised in a vacuum apparatus (S33). If the substrate temperature is raised without any operation, the termination hydrogen is released. Before the hydrogen was released, pre-irradiation with As was performed (S34). Thus, an interface between the Si substrate and the compound semiconductor layer was prepared. Several minutes later, irradiation with Ga and As was performed (S35). Thereby, the compound semiconductor was formed (S36).";"EP";1;4;"15196973";"1040-8436"

The technical result is achieved by melting the feed with at least two electronic beams in a cooled device equipped with heat insulator, which provides various levels of heat transfer from the melt to the cooled device in its different parts, subsequent formation of circular heating zone on the surface of the melt by electron beam scanning and seeded pulling of an ingot of set diameter. Purification is ensured before pulling by feeding the charge in portions arid exposing the melt to reduced pressure. The process is controlled, by changing the pulling speed, input energy amounts, as well as the position and width of the circular heating zone, which intensifies the purification process by frequent periodic stirring of the melt. The whole cycle is repeated with, pulled ingot removed from the plant.";"WO";1;1;"IB2016/050225";"0022-0248"

The technical result is achieved by the fact that the method of ingot growing from the melt involves the melting of the charge using at least two electron beams in a cooled device equipped with heat insulator, which provides various levels of heat transfer from the melt to the cooled device in its different parts, formation of circular zone of beams affecting the surface of the melt by way of electron beam scanning and seeded pulling of an ingot of set diameter. Purification is ensured before pulling by feeding the charge in portions and exposing the melt to reduced pressure. The process is controlled by changing the pulling speed, input energy amounts, as well as the position and width of the circular heating zone, which intensifies the purification process by frequent periodic stirring of the melt. The whole cycle is repeated with pulled ingot removed from the plant.";"EP";1;1;"16705990";"0022-0248"
