9,451,054	Reliable transport layer protocol in low performance 8-bit microcontrollers	A reliable communication protocol RUDP is provided to transfer data between two systems connected in a network. Working over the unreliable UDP transport layer protocol, the RUDP protocol adds an acknowledging mechanism to otherwise unreliable UDP packets. Contrary to the TCP transport layer protocol, which establishes a connection before any data transfer, the RUDP is used to transfer short amounts of information or messages, so a connectionless communication is used. In a connectionless context the complexity of the encoding-decoding algorithm and the amount of memory consumed by the protocol is reduced. Such characteristics makes the RUDP protocol suitable for its implementation in systems with limited memory and speed, like low processing power 8-bit microcontrollers. Furthermore, by programming the RUDP protocol over the UDP protocol, its implementation in a personal computer can be made with common programming tools.

8,301,382	Continuous geomechanically stable wellbore trajectories	A continuous geomechanically stable trajectory in a subterranean formation is found by calculating at least one reachable stable position relative to a starting position based on geological data indicative of characteristics of the subterranean formation, and iteratively utilizing the calculated reachable stable position as a new starting position. The calculation may be constrained by a boundary including selected distance and direction relative to the starting position, and selected rate of angle change. Within the constraints of the boundary, the possible new trajectories considered may be discretized. The result of the calculations is a three dimensional tree which defines a stability volume. Pruning of at least some branches of the tree may be employed so that not all stable positions have the preselected number of branches, thereby helping to elongate the tree. Either or both of the tree and stability volume are used to select at least one trajectory. For example, the trajectory may be selected from sets of interconnected stable wellbore positions, or based on some other criteria constrained by the stability volume. The trajectory is then used as the basis for drilling a borehole.

These mesophase fluids use extended chain surfactants having propoxylated/ethoxylated spacer arms. The extended chain surfactants are intramolecular mixtures containing hydrophilic and lipophilic portions. They attain high solubilization in the mesophase fluids (e.g. single phase microemulsions), are in some instances insensitive to temperature and are useful for a wide variety of oil types.

8,225,870	Method for making windows in oil well casings	A method for making gravel filters in oil well bores. The first step involves ascertaining the location of a producing formation adjacent to a cemented casing in a well bore. Then, a portion of the casing adjacent to the producing formation is cut, enlarging the bore adjacent to the producing formation. Subsequently, a sufficient amount of gravel is deposited in the enlarged portion of the bore to create an effective filter for a producing tube with a screen at its distal end. The distal end is positioned adjacent to the cemented bottom of the well bore. The method maximizes the diameter of the gravel deposited by delivering it exteriorly of the screen of the producing tube and through the annular space defined and sealed between the screen and the casing.

7,224,845	Bijection mapping for compression/denoising of multi-frame images	A new approach to multispectral image compression where the intra- and cross-band correlations are jointly exploited in a surprisingly simple yet very effective manner. The key component of the algorithm is a bijection mapping of the original multispectral image into a virtual 2 dimensional scalar image. By optimally mapping the multispectral image set into a single 2 dimensional array and by subsequently applying a scalar image coding algorithm, the spatial correlation and the spectral correlation of the multispectral data set are jointly exploited. Based on the statistical characteristics of the multispectral data, the bijection mapping can be optimized to minimize the distortion introduced by the compression algorithm. The optimization reduces to the maximization of a function of the second-order statistics of the multispectral data. At high compression rates, the new algorithm outperforms traditional compression algorithms whenever the cross-band correlation is high and it yields comparable performance at low compression rates.

6,880,100	Peer-to-peer fault detection	This inventions discloses a fault or abnormal status detection mechanism applied to distributed networks considering a shared media. A set of programmed routines executing in every node connected to a distributed network establish pairs of inter-monitoring nodes. At system power up, every node searches for another free, unpaired node using random timeout messaging generation to prevent collisions of network messages. After all pairs have been formed, a periodic check message is sent from one node to its associated partner (and vice versa) requesting its operating status. A response, containing a node's status, is generated upon receipt of a check message. If an abnormal status is received, or there is no response, a report is sent to a monitoring station or stored as a failure network event. The timeout period, in the order of seconds, between each check message is adjusted according to the number of connected nodes and available network bandwidth. This prevents excessive traffic generation that could affect performance. A longer timeout period, in the order of minutes, indicates when to restart the pair assignation process again, periodically changing all established pairs.

6,654,861	Method to manage multiple communication queues in an 8-bit microcontroller	A method and algorithm to handle a memory bank queue using a low processing power 8-bit microcontroller is provided. The microcontroller is used to receive information in the form of a data packet from a communication interface shared with an external system. Each received packet is temporarily stored in a logical FIFO queue while the first packet in the queue packet is processed, modified or decoded according to a process or algorithm made by the user. The result keeps the same queue position until a second system is able to receive it through a second communication interface. In the same manner, any information packet coming from the second system is queued and processed back to retrieve a result to the first processor. This invention provides a mechanism to maintain two or more logic queues sharing the same physical RAM, one for each kind of process related to packets flowing from one interface to another. A banked memory structure is used, considering each bank as a generic memory buffer that can be occupied by any of the existing queues. Adequate information about each queue is stored to keep the queue's logic order. Appropriate low-complexity algorithms have been defined to use such information to manage the available buffers, suitable to the processing power of an 8-bit microcontroller.

6,370,189	Apparatus and methods for variable delay channel tracking	The present invention provides apparatus and methods in which variable delay is provided for channel tracking. In particular, a demodulator having both a hard output (or symbol estimate) and a soft output (or indication of the quality of the symbol estimate) is coupled to a channel tracker. The channel tracker provides a channel estimate used by the demodulator, in part, to correct for fading. The channel tracker updates the channel estimate based on the symbol estimates from the demodulator and the received signal. However, when the soft output indicates a low confidence in the symbol estimate, the symbol estimate is not used to update the channel estimate. This is accomplished by providing a variable delay to the channel estimate calculation performed by the channel tracker depending on the number of consecutive suspect symbol estimates. For example, a single suspect estimate generates a delay of one causing the most recent estimate to not be used, two consecutive suspect estimate generates a delay of two causing the two most recent estimates to not be used and so on. Accordingly, the channel tracker of the present invention utilizes only the most reliable data available locally to generate a channel estimate for use by the demodulator.

6,213,307	Fluid-bed cleaner and grades sorter for particle form materials	A first stage chamber has upwardly diverging walls so that an upward airstream has different air velocities at different heights in the chamber. When particles such as seeds are fed homogeneously along the chamber top length, they reach equilibrium at different heights depending on their weights and volatilities. The particles suspended and classified at different heights are conveyed by a horizontal airstream in parallel horizontal channels toward a chamber side wall, where they are removed by suction. Ribbed sections adjacent to the channels divide the chamber into deviating cascaded pathways, where the upward air velocity is homogenized and an opposite horizontal airstream conveys falling particles toward the side wall opposite to that on which the particles are removed, to thereby homogenize the spread of particles in the chamber. Light trash is removed through a convergent top section toward a cyclone. Heavy particles not suspended in the chamber are collected and removed at the chamber bottom. A second stage receives the particles removed at a sidewall of the first stage and performs a further separation by ballistically projecting the particles into one of two groups depending on the adjustable horizontal extent of the ballistic projection of the particles.

With this arrangement, during initial drilling through softer formation, most of the removal of formation will be effected by the outermost of the abrasive pads and little or no formation will be removed by the more inward pads. Accordingly, the bit will act as a lighter set bit and good rates of penetration may be achieved. As drilling proceeds and the bit wears, which may occur more rapidly as the bit meets harder formations, the more outwardly disposed pads will wear down more than the inwardly disposed pads so that the inwardly disposed pads will begin to contribute more to the cutting action of the bit, so that the bit effectively becomes heavier set. As drilling progresses to a point where all of the pads wear down to the same level, the bit will then act as a conventional heavy set bit where all the abrasive surfaces lie on the same profile.

5,481,748	Method and apparatus for reducing the processing time required to solve numerical problems	The invention discloses a method and apparatus for solving a wide range of numerical problems that use N processing elements operating in parallel. To find the solution for a given problem relating to a given function function N points are selected in a determined interval wherein resides the solution. Such interval is known as the initial search interval and it is determined according to said given problem. Once the N points are selected the search interval is divided into smaller sub-intervals. The N processing elements are used to perform evaluations of the function at each of the N selected points, whereby the criteria for said evaluations are also determined according to said given problem. The results of the evaluations are used to determine the next search interval that is smaller than the previous one. The new search interval is divided into smaller parts in the same fashion as described above and further function evaluations are performed at given selected points. The aforementioned steps are repeated until the search interval is reduced to a predetermined size which is also defined according to said given problem. At this point the solution for said given problem can be selected from this last search interval known as the final interval. The apparatus for the present invention uses N processing elements operating in parallel to perform evaluations of the given function at selected points. When the invention is applied in digital computers for solving numerical problems involving a floating point domain, where points are represented by binary numbers according to a given pattern, selection of the N points in the search interval is implemented by a series of assemblers that build binary numbers.

In a preferred embodiment the catalyst has a low cobalt content, between 0.5% and 2.0% by weight calculated as CoO, and a molybdenum content of between 10% and 20% by weight, calculated as MoO.sub.3. The phosphorus or boron compounds added to the aluminum before the impregnation of the active metals prevents the formation of undesirable compounds of the CoAl.sub.2 O.sub.4 type, which is inactive in HDS. It is for that reason that the catalyst has a formulation with 70% less cobalt than the previous state-of-the-art catalysts. Very small crystals, highly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst, whose formula is CoMoO.sub.4, are responsible for the stability and the high level of activity in HDS and HDN which results.

4,499,202	Hydrocracking catalyst	The invention relates to a particular method for the preparation of a hydrocracking catalyst, using a high iron content bauxite as a basis. This bauxite is ground and screened to a specific size and mixed with three types of additives: a promoter additive of the P, Mo, Co, Ni, W type. A hardener additive of the phosphoric acid type, ammonium phosphate. And a lubricant and pore-generating additive of the polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene-glycol, starch type. The particularity consists in that the three additives are added simultaneously during the extrusion of the sample. That way, a particular surface composition is obtained which allows for the activity of the catalyst. Extruded products are obtained in sizes of 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32" and submitted to drying and calcination programs for their activation. The obtained catalyst offers a good mechanical strength, a high content in macropores and a high activity, specifically for the hydrocracking of heavy Venezuelan crudes or residues.

4,490,252	Electrostatic scale control apparatus for feed water having rotating helix responsive to water flow rate	A magnetic apparatus comprising an electromagnetic coil surrounding a feed water inlet tube, having an electrical D.C. winding about the tube and a ferromagnetic helix closely fitting within the inside of the tube rotating in response to water pressure. The magnetic helix which rotates in response to water flow in the casing fits quite closely to the inner wall of the tube, the helix being only slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the tube to thereby create a flow directed tangentially along the tube surface the helix further creates an induced electromagnetic field interaction with the winding to direct the magnetic lines of force within the casing. This combines electromagnetic forces and water flowing forces to prevent calcareous deposition along the walls of said casing and to assist in keeping the walls of deposits. The impeller is formed of a helical band rotating on a shaft which is journalled on a finned support which is fitted within the pipe at a wider diameter where it tapers to a narrower diameter so that the impeller unit can be withdrawn from the tube by pulling it back in the wider inner portion of the feed water inlet tube against the direction of the water flow. Thus the tapered feed water inlet tube serves to lock the impeller unit in place.	December 25, 1984	Brigante; Miguel F. (Caracas, VE)	C02F 1/48 (20060101); B01D 035/06 ()

4,437,889	Method of recovering silver from solid and liquid photographic waste	Silver is recovered from photographic wastes, whether liquid (used developing solution) or a solid (used film) in a completely nonelectrolytic system using a series of physical-chemical reactions. With liquid wastes this is done by first heating them above ambient temperature to a temperature between 45.degree. C. and 65.degree. C. and then mixing them with aqueous nitric acid at a concentration of 65% and having a specific density of 1.40 g/ml. The quantity of nitric acid used forms a liquid: acid ratio with the liquid being treated of between 1:10 and 1:6. The mixture is then allowed to macerate for between 0.7 and 1.5 hours while it is continuously filtered. The filtration residue is then subjected to a second heating to about 600.degree.-700.degree. C. until it turns gray, then it is fused in a closed furnace. The fused product is then dumped directly into water to solidify and produce pure silver. For solid wastes the digestion with nitric acid takes place before calcining the solid materials. This produces a carbonaceous residue which is pulverized and diluted with the nitric acid as with liquid wastes.

4,434,669	Apparatus for transmitting and receiving sound	In an ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter for measuring blood flow it is necessary to change the frequency of insonation according to the site and size of a vessel to be investigated. Several different crystal pairs are employed in a single probe, each pair associated with a different frequency. All of the transmitting crystals are connected in parallel, and all of the receiving crystals are connected in parallel. As a result, the single probe is suitable for investigating blood flow in different blood vessel conditions. Optimum insonation frequency selection is achieved by use of a voltage controlled oscillator, and a frequency control circuit which compares powers received at different frequencies. Signals representative of blood velocities appear at the output of a scaler which ensures that the same velocity provides the same output independently of frequency of insonation.
