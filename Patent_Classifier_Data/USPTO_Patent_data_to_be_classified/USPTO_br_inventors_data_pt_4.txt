In a second aspect, the invention takes a set of orders defined to be produced next in the Melt Shop area in a steel mill and groups them in small sets of orders with similar characteristics, called heats. Each order belongs to a heat. The system defines the precise moment that each heat has to be processed in each of its steps. In another aspect, the invention uses an event-driven based algorithm as a general approach for scheduling all the processing units with their specific constraints and the metallic units from hot coils to the finished products at the shipping areas.

6,682,900	Serological diagnosis of Chagas' disease	A chemiluminescent (CL)-ELISA method with purified and complex antigens of Trypanosoma cruzi is proposed for the specific and sensitive diagnosis of Chagas' disease in patients and blood bank samples. A trypomastigote specific antigen (A&T) together with an epimastigote extract (EpEx), used as a control of sensitivity, are the preparations used. The high sensitivity of the CL-ELISA method permits the use of extremely small amounts of antigen and allows a serum dilution in routine tests as high as 1:2000, thus reducing the nonspecific or false-positive reactions to a minimum. The use of the A&T purified antigen eliminates cross-reactivities with other infectious agents, detects active infection, and serves to monitor chemotherapy in chronic patients. The use of the EpEx antigenic preparation not only confirms the positive results with A&T but also, in case of discrepancy, suggests other infections such as leishmaniasis. In comparison with current tests used in major blood banks, the CL-ELISA method with A&T and EpEx antigens, tested in parallel, proved to be clearly superior either by eliminating indeterminate results or by increasing the statistics of diagnosed positive samples.

6,618,676	Efficient and accurate pseudo 2-D inversion scheme for multicomponent induction log data	A fast, efficient and accurate pseudo 2-D inversion scheme for resistivity determination of an anisotropic formation uses data from a tool (3DEX) comprising three transmitters and three corresponding receivers sampling the formation in a plurality of spatial directions. An initial model of the formation including invasion zones is obtained using a conventional multifrequency and/or multispacing logging tool. A pseudo 2-D inversion scheme combines an accurate full 2-D forward solution of the synthetic responses of the earth model with a 1-D approximation of the sensitivity matrix of the horizontally layered anisotropic background model. The timesaving compared to a regular 2-D inversion scheme can be tremendous. The applicability of this scheme is important in cases when borehole and near-zone effects do not allow an interpretation based on 1-D inversion. A comparison of the pseudo 2-D inversion scheme versus a full 2-D inversion using a realistic synthetic example shows that the pseudo 2-D inversion scheme performs as well as the full 2-D inversion, but in a much shorter time.

The system includes a stabilizing device and a deployment system composed of first and second coacting tools. The stabilizing device is made up of an expandable threaded insert and an expansion screw. The threaded insert is a hollow cylindrical member having a central cylindrical threaded bore, and a self tapping helical thread extending about the outer periphery of the member. The member is split at its proximal end in communication with the bore to form a pair of slots extending parallel to its longitudinal axis. The expandable insert is arranged to be screwed by the first tool into the intervertebral space between the superior and inferior vertebrae to a desired depth and with the slots oriented in a plane generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vertebral column. The first tool includes a pair of extending fingers which fit into the slots to achieve that end. When screwed in, the self-tapping threads cut into the cortical bone of the superior and inferior vertebrae contiguous to the intervertebral space, but not substantially into the cancellous bone. The expansion screw is tapered and arranged to be screwed into the internally threaded bore in the expandable insert by the second tool. The second tool fits into the first tool. When the expansion insert is screwed into the expandable insert it causes the slots of the expandable insert to open and thereby spread the superior and inferior vertebrae apart, thereby stabilizing the being's vertebral column.

6,431,169	Mini pneumatic mechanical pulmonary ventilator	The present invention discloses a pneumatic, mechanical, pulmonary ventilator apparatus. The apparatus operates to dilute and limit the pressure of various gases delivered to a patient. The function of the apparatus may be described as an astatic multi-vibrator, which is activated by pressurized gas (e.g., such as oxygen or medical compressed air). The gas output of the apparatus may be described as a square wave, wherein the high wave phase corresponds to the inspiratory phase (the duration is the inspiratory time) and the low wave phase corresponds to the expiratory phase (the duration is the expiratory time). The sum of the two phases corresponds to the respiratory cycle. The device includes a rubber diaphragm having a ring shape to cyclically block a gas source aperture inlet. An adjustable needle valve, which controls the gas pressure in a small chamber on the opposite side of the diaphragm, together with a helical spring provide for tuning the two cycle phases. A venturi system limits the delivered pressure of gas to the patient and remains open during all cycles, thereby enabling the patient to breath independent of the cycle of the apparatus.

6,430,029	Capacitor terminal	The present invention relates to an electric capacitor and, more specifically, to its electrical terminals. One problem that occurs while mounting the capacitor provided with the standard terminals on a pc board, is that the capsule is positioned to close to it and thus leaving no space between said board and the capsule resulting in a big difficulty to clean the board after the electrical components that have been welded to it. This problem is especially critical since, after the welding stage, the pc board has to be washed with a cleaning solution that can be stuck on said terminals resulting in malfunction of the electrical circuit. The solution that is known so far is the use of steps assembled in the cover disc. The solution of the present invention is achieved by a capacitor terminal for a capacitor, the terminals being formed of a substantially planar plate, said plate having at least one first projection and a second projection the second projection being adequate to be inserted in the openings of a pc board, the first projection being wider than the second projection and at least wider than said openings of said pc board.

6,400,277	Monitor for detecting failures of neon sign transformers	A monitor for detecting failures in the installation of neon gas sign transformers has an electronic circuit in the transformer compartment to turn the transformer off in the event any failure occurs. The monitor uses a programmed digital micro-controller connected to the transformer and supplies an exciting current to a "TRIAC" that turns on/off the primary coil of the transformer under an AC voltage of the distribution network and also supplies a current to turn on a red LED when failures occur and a green LED that indicates if any power is being fed from the distribution network. When the sign lights properly, the TRIAC is activated, the transformer remains activated and the red LED remains inactivated while the green LED remains activated. When there is any failure the monitor detects the failure immediately and the transformer is turned off and six seconds later it is automatically turned on again. If the cause of the failure disappears, the transformer continues operating regularly. However, if the failure is not overcome, the transformer is switched off for a second time, and six seconds later the transformer is switched on again. If even so the failure is not overcome, the transformer is switched off for the third time, at which time a warning LED starts blinking also showing the type of failure by its blinking rate.

6,318,962	Device for generating an aerodynamic force by rotational movement	A generator of aerodynamic force by rotational movement, by means of a device which, starting from a rotational movement, induces a field of velocities in the surrounding fluid, which produces a difference in pressure on a surface, which in turn results in an aerodynamic force. The rotor element (1) is set in rotation at high speed by a motor (3). The rotational movement of the rotor element causes the fluid in which the device is immersed to assume a rotational movement, the velocity of the fluid layer that is in contact with the cylinder being equal to the velocity of a point at the surface of the cylinder. The planar element (2) separates the fluid into two regions. The fluid in the region below the surface is motionless, whereas the fluid above the surface is in motion. Since the higher the velocity of the fluid the lower its pressure, the fluid in the region below the surface exerts a higher pressure than that exerted by the fluid in the region below the surface. This difference in pressure results in a force that acts on the surface.

6,240,870	Anchor	The present invention relates to an anchor which may be buried in the seabed by means of the actual mooring line. One embodiment of such an anchor (25) comprises a fluke (1) which has rear eyes (3, 3A), front eyes (2A, 2B) and auxiliary eyes (4A, 4B). Rear mooring cables (9A, 9B) are connected to the rear eyes (3A, 3B) and front mooring cables (8A, 8B) are connected to rear connection points (17A, 17B) located on the front eyes (2A, 2B). Front installation cables (7A, 7B), which are shorter than the front mooring cables (8A, 8B), are connected to front connection points (16A, 16B) on the front eyes (2A, 2B). The remaining ends of these cables are connected to a connection plate (5), forming the anchor bobstay, and a mooring line is connected to the top of this connection plate (5). As the front installation cables (7A, 7B) are shorter than the rear mooring cables (9A, 9B), the bobstay is configured with the desired angle of attack for the burial of the anchor (25). In order that the front mooring cables (8A, 8B) do not slacken, use is made of auxiliary cables (10A, 10B) to stretch them out. When the anchor has been buried, a movement of the mooring line (6) in the opposite direction from the burial direction will cause the ends of the front installation cables (7A, 7B) to break auxillary clamps (11A, 11B) which exist at front connection points (16A, 16B), thereby releasing these ends and, consequently, making it possible for the front mooring lines (8A, 8B) to be stretched out, so as to place the anchor in its operating position.

6,226,774	System and method for generating a hazard-free asynchronous circuit	A flip-flop-based circuit architecture generates a hazard-free asynchronous signal given the SET and RESET sum-of-product (SOP) solutions to an asynchronous process. The flip-flop SET and RESET SOP solutions can be hazardous. Thus, general purpose synchronous optimization tools (which are indifferent to hazards) can be used to derive the optimal SOP solutions. A fixed layer built around the SOP cores eliminates all hazards in the circuit. In one embodiment, the architecture is optimized by eliminating an RS latch and delay lines in the SOP cores. The architecture of the present invention is guaranteed to admit any semi-modular race-free state graph representation of an asynchronous process that satisfies the n-shot requirement. The state graph representations can be examined to determine if alternate, solution-specific, simplified architectures can be employed that further decrease the final area by the elimination of flip-flops or the elimination of a timing delay.

6,220,612	Cambering vehicle and mechanism	A cambering vehicle includes a single steerable front wheel and a pair of rear wheels at the rearward ends of trailing arms extending from the front structure. The two trailing arms are articulated to the front structure, and may move arcuately in a plane parallel to the front wheel column of the vehicle. The two trailing arms are linked together by a novel yoke mechanism, and move in opposite directions but in equal arcuate distances relative to one another. The vehicle operates using the principle of conservation of angular momentum, with the vehicle traveling a sinusoidal path and the operator leaning to the inside of the turn. This moves the center of gravity of the vehicle and operator to the inside of the turn, thus accelerating the vehicle and operator along the path of the turn to increase the velocity of the device. The yoke mechanism of the vehicle may be quickly and easily removed, thus allowing the vehicle to be folded for storage. The yoke mechanism also allows the vehicle to be provided with a simple, fixed stop mechanism for limiting the arcuate travel of the two trailing arms. The present vehicle is also equipped with brakes for the two rear wheels, with dual operator controls independently actuating each brake.

As the level of the aqueous phase drops, the plug portion (25) settles sealingly on the seat (26), halting the drainage operation since all the accumulated aqueous phase has already been drained off. The drainage system may be automatic or manual. In the former case, use is made of a sensor (12) for detecting the presence of an aqueous phase and commanding the process of opening a shut-off valve (11) and allowing drainage of the accumulated aqueous phase. In the manual case, an operator periodically checks for the presence of an aqueous phase inside the storage tank (1), through a port (28) for inspecting the level. If such a phase were to accumulate, he opens a manual shut-off valve (29) so as to allow all the accumulated aqueous phase to drain away.

5,899,243	Method for adding and removing a liquid product from an atmospheric storage tank	A method for adding or removing a liquid product to or from a tank using a breather bag attached to an upper air vent of the tank. Prior to adding a liquid product, the bag is filled with external air either by force or atmospheric pressure, and a liquid product is added to the tank between the bag and tank while simultaneously forcing the external air out of the bag by force on the bag caused by addition of a liquid product into the tank. As liquid product is removed from the tank through an outlet valve, the breather bag is sucked downward by the vacuum created between the bag and tank as the liquid product is removed. In both processes, the liquid product is separated from the external air by the breather bag, yielding the following advantages. Evaporative losses of liquid products stored in atmospheric tanks are averted. Thus, environmental pollution by product gases that would be expelled out of the tanks is avoided. The entry of flames due to fire in atmospheric storage tanks that contain flammable or combustible liquids is avoided, so that the chances of an accident are reduced. Hydrocontamination of stored liquid product by water present in atmospheric air in atmospheric storage tanks is also avoided. Likewise, contact between the stored liquid product and atmospheric air oxidizing compounds can be avoided. Finally, the entry of extraneous objects into liquid products stored in atmospheric storage tanks like insects and small animals or birds, which may infect the stored liquid products, is avoided.

5,870,700	Brazilian Portuguese grammar checker	A process for checking the Brazilian-Portuguese grammar of original text provided by a user. For each sentence, a token is generated to correspond to each of the words in the sentence. For each word in the sentence, an orthographic dictionary is searched to find possible variations in spelling, meaning and grammatical classification. Each token is expanded to include the variations in spelling, meaning and grammatical classification of its corresponding word. Each token is submitted to a heuristic process for excluding any variation which is incompatible with the token's juxtaposition within the sentence. Pre-analysis rules are applied to each token to identify and determine positionally correct alternatives for select pre-analysis errors in grammar based on the juxtaposition of each word within said sentence. An analysis tree, containing all of the tokens for the sentence and recording syntactic classification of the tokens and groups of tokens, is generated for the sentence. A set of grammar rules having terminal elements, special predicates, and non-terminal elements is generated as well. The set of grammar rules is applied to each token of the analysis tree by following analysis paths, including a so-called low-cost analysis path, in order to find cost errors in the analysis tree. It is determined which of the analysis paths is the low-cost analysis path, wherein the low-cost analysis has the fewest cost errors for the sentence. Any cost errors found in the analysis tree by analysis via the low-cost analysis path are reported to the user.	DTS Software, Inc.

5,811,957	Speed sensorless hybrid vector controlled induction motor with zero speed operation	A speed sensorless hybrid vector control starts from zero speed by using indirect vector control with stator frequency equal to slip frequency. As soon as the rotor begins to rotate, the drive is converted to direct vector control for normal operation. The direct vector control uses several low pass filters. The first is a harmonic reducing filter for the sensed motor phase current and voltage signals. The others comprise integration apparatus used in the calculation of motor flux quantities from the motor phase current and voltage signals. One of these other filters has a phase lag which is variable in response to stator frequency to compensate for phase lag introduced by the harmonic reducing filter; and the apparatus is thus able to produce a phase compensated set of unit vectors for vector rotation of the commanded stator voltage components from the synchronous to the stationary reference frame as well as a set of non-phase compensated unit vectors for inverse vector rotation of the estimated stator current components from the stationary to the synchronous reference frame. This allows the motor to operate at any point in the torque speed range, down to zero speed if a braking load torque is applied against a smaller input commanded torque, with the resulting torque current flow allowing the drive to remain in direct vector control.

5,811,240	Species-specific mitochondrial sequences for identification of Tilletia indica, the karnal bunt wheat fungus and methods of using said sequences	Mitochondrial DNA of five isolates of Tilletia indica was isolated and digested with several restriction enzymes. A 2.3 kb- EcoRI fragment was chosen, cloned, and shown to hybridize with total DNA restricted with EcoRI from T. indica and not from a morphologically similar smut fungus, T. barclayana. The clone was partially sequenced, primers were designed and tested under high-stringency conditions in PCR assays. The primer pair Ti1/Ti4 amplified a 2.3 kb fragment from total DNA of 17 T. indica isolates from India, Pakistan and Mexico. DNA from 25 isolates of other smut fungi (T. barclayana, T. foetida, T. caries, T. fusca and T. controversa) did not produce any bands as detected by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and Southern hybridizations. Sensitivity of the assay was determined and increased by using a single nested primer in a second round of amplification, so that 1 pg of total mycelial DNA could be detected. The results indicated that the primers which originated from a cloned mtDNA sequence can be used to differentiate T. indica from other Tilletia species and have the potential to identify teliospores contaminating wheat seeds.

5,748,487	System and method for generating a hazard-free asynchronous circuit	A flip-flop-based circuit architecture generates a hazard-free asynchronous signal given the SET and RESET sum-of-product (SOP) solutions to an asynchronous process. The flip-flop SET and RESET SOP solutions can be hazardous. Thus, general purpose synchronous optimization tools (which are indifferent to hazards) can be used to derive the optimal SOP solutions. A fixed layer built around the SOP cores eliminates all hazards in the circuit. In one embodiment, the architecture is optimized by eliminating an RS latch and delay lines in the SOP cores. The architecture of the present invention is guaranteed to admit any semi-modular race-free state graph representation of an asynchronous process that satisfies the n-shot requirement. The state graph representations can be examined to determine if alternate, solution-specific, simplified architectures can be employed that further decrease the final area by the elimination of flip-flops or the elimination of a timing delay.

5,601,425	Staged combustion for reducing nitrogen oxides	A combustion method is provided for carrying out combustion with reduced generation of nitrogen oxides. The combustion method involves partially combusting a fluid fuel stream with a low velocity oxidant and thereafter mixing and combusting the resulting product with a secondary oxidant stream diluted with ambient gas. The velocity of the secondary oxidant stream is either increased to reduce the nitrogen oxides emission level or adjusted to provide the desired secondary oxidant/low velocity oxidant ratio which is useful for further decreasing the formation of nitrogen oxides. Normally, increasing the ratio and/or velocity further decreases the nitrogen oxides emission level. When liquid fuel is employed, it is atomized with atomizing fluid in such a manner to produce a liquid fuel stream having a very narrow spray angle. The production of such a stream allows the burner to be operated without water cooling. Moreover, such a stream, when combined with the above combustion method, unexpectedly provides effective and efficient combustion with reduced generation of nitrogen oxides.	Praxair Technology, Inc.

In the process the process heat is supplied by heat carrier particles which are heated within a substantially closed circuit in a heater (5) by combustion gases which are produced in a combustion chamber (3), and passed through the reactor (1) in counter-flow relationship with the gasification substance or the gas to be reformed and the gasification agent, and then returned to the heater (5) for renewed heating. In accordance with the invention the particles and the combustion gas form a fluidized bed above at least one grid (34, 34a, 34b, 34c, 34d, 34e) arranged in the heater (5). The particles flow out of the heater (5) into the adjoining combustion chamber (3) in which they form a fluidized bed with the combustion gas and pass by way of a flow transfer pipe (7, 7') out of the combustion chamber (3) into an upper region of the reactor (1). The throughput of particles through the flow transfer pipe (7, 7') forms a seal which prevents a throughflow of product gas which is generated in the reactor (1). The particles form one or more fluidized beds in the reactor (1) with the gasification substance and/or the gas to be reformed.

5,531,117	Closed loop maximum likelihood phase aberration correction in phased-array imaging systems	A phased array ultrasonic imaging system performs a scan in which beamforming time delay errors due to nonuniformity in ultrasound speed within the transmission medium are corrected by estimating and correcting phase aberrations in accordance with the maximum likelihood theory. The system employs a multiple-channel transmitter and receiver, and estimates phase values, not phase difference values, thereby eliminating any need to perform an integration to produce the phase aberration profile. The method can be implemented in real-time, allowing correct data to flow out of the circuit which at the same time can be receiving new input data. Delays can be added to allow for phase aberration correction of past measurements. The method allows tracking, to some extent, of variations that may occur in the phase aberrations. Depending on the number of channels that are simultaneously considered, different closed loop circuits can be employed. A one-dimensional closed loop circuit, for example, estimates the phase aberration affecting one single channel, while a two dimensional closed loop circuit jointly estimates the phase aberrations affecting two of the channels.

5,515,439	Exchange certificate for one way validation of information	In a communications system, a method is described allowing two users having established a communication session identified by a unique session freshness proof, to transmit and validate a new value of a variable by using an exchange certificate which combines the following elements: the new value of the variable, a common secret key known by both users, an exchange counter representative of the number of values of said variable transmitted between the two users during the current communication session and a session freshness proof. Protection against potential eavesdroppers and intruders is provided by combining cryptographically the elements of the exchange certificate. Further protection is obtained by interrupting the current communication session and opening a new one characterized by a new unique session freshness proof when the exchange counter reaches its maximum value; thus avoiding the risk that the same value of the session freshness keeps being used when the exchange counter is reset to its initial value. Consequently a given pair of values of the session freshness proof and of the exchange counter will never be used more than one time, making eavesdropping and, replaying attacks from intruders more difficult. Preferably, the method used for opening a new communication session uses already known authentication methods based on the common secret key.

5,448,990	Endoscope viewing cannula and surgical techniques	An improved endoscope assembly for exploratory and general surgery which permits exceptional vision while eliminating the requirement of both washing of the lense and expansion of the body cavity. Using a standard endoscope, a housing is placed over the end of the endoscope. The housing is equipped with a window for viewing through by the endoscope's viewing tip. The window is arranged at an angle different from the angle of the viewing tip so that light is reflected back into the housing, and not into the viewing tip. The interior of the housing is coated with a light absorbing material to eliminate back-scattering of light into the viewing tip of the endoscope which degrades the endoscope's vision. An air-chamber between the viewing tip of the endoscope and the window assures the crispest vision possible. Further, fogging of the window is eliminated through the use of heating wires, dry gases, or the like so that the endoscope is also useful for cadaver lessons. Because of the improved clarity due to the different angles and the air-chamber, the endoscope is used without the aid of washing or with the expansion of the body cavity.

5,403,164	Air compressor for internal combustion two cycle engines	A passive compressor is disclosed which includes a free piston or a flexible membrane whose movement is controlled by pressure variations in a main chamber. The pressure in the main chamber changes according to the pressure in the motor crankcase, as the main chamber is coupled to the crankcase by a crankcase transfer passage duct. As the free piston or flexible membrane moves towards the main chamber, it causes a pressure decrease in the air chamber which subsequently admits external air through an inlet valve. When the free piston or the flexible membrane moves in the direction of the air chamber, the increased pressure on the piston or membrane forces the external air into the motor cylinder, through an air transfer passage duct, and towards a port on the cylinder that is opened due to the position of the motor piston. The inlet valve prevents the loss of pressure in the air chamber. Alternatively, the main chamber may be directly attached to the motor crankcase. In such case, the crankcase transfer passage duct is not provided. The compressor may be equipped with a device for discharging the combustion gases that pass from the motor crankcase. In the compressor equipped with a free piston, the device includes passage holes, a cap and an oil separator. In the compressor with the flexible membrane, the device includes an auxiliary piston, an auxiliary cylinder and a cap which has an entrance for placing the oil separator.		Gama; Luciano N.

5,334,771	Peroxidation of secondary carbon in alkanes and cycloalkanes	A secondary carbon atom in an alkane, including alkyl groups attached to aromatic rings, or cycloalkane is peroxidized by molecular oxygen to the corresponding hydroperoxide in the absence of a catalyst. The peroxidation is carried out in the presence of a tertiary hydroperoxide initiator which provides the free radicals needed to maintain the reaction. The amount of tertiary alcohol in the initiator is limited. The initial product of the peroxidation contains the secondary hydroperoxide as well as unreacted hydrocarbon, unreacted tertiary hydroperoxide and tertiary alcohol. The tertiary alcohol is removed as an azeotrope with part of the unreacted hydrocarbon which may be then separated from the alcohol and recycled. A second azeotropic distillation follows where the unreacted tertiary hydroperoxide is removed as an azeotrope with the rest of the unreacted hydrocarbon. This azeotrope is directly recycled to the peroxidation reaction.	ABB Lummus Crest Inc.	Ember; George (Hackensack, NJ), De Castro Netro; Edilberto A. (Bahia, BR), De Lacerda; Rogerio F.

5,284,534	Thermomechanical methods for improving the fatigue characteristics of metallic materials	A thermomechanical method for improving the fatigue characteristics of a metallic material (for example carbon steel and low alloy steel) takes advantage of the materials' plastic flow characteristics to improve external and internal surface conditions. The material is heated to a temperature in the range of about 0.3 to 0.45 its homologous temperature, e.g., from about 200 degrees C to about the Young's Modulus Transition Temperature of said material. While the temperature of the material is in this range, force is applied to the material to produce in at least the region of said material to be treated a tensile stress level greater than the yield point of said material at the temperature, and thereby to produce limited plastic elongation in the region. The material is then cooled under stress, the stress being maintained above the instantaneous yield point of the material during at least part of the cooling process. As a result of this process, the shape of existing stress raisers (e.g., radii at the base of cracks and flaws) are changed in ways which lower stress concentration factors in the material.

5,282,508	Process to increase petroleum recovery from petroleum reservoirs	A process and apparatus are provided to enhance the recovery of petroleum from onshore and offshore reservoirs. The process includes the simultaneous stimulation of the formation by elastic sound waves, created by a sonic source installed at the oil well so that the elastic sonic waves which are superimposed reduce the adherence forces in the layer between oil/water and the rock formation, and by the oscillating electrical stimulation of the same layer, as from the same wells subject to sonic treatment. The electricity heats the formation by using resistive heating, and thus increases the pressure, thus eliminating the surface tensions between the faces of the fluid as a consequence of the oscillatory action of the ions in the surfaces of the fluid and in addition, reducing the viscosity of the fluids. The process is achieved as the petroleum is produced in the wells thus treated, and the flow of petroleum acts then as a cooling agent which removes the heat released by the well area and thus allows a larger input of energy than in any other method known so far.

5,107,798	Composite studs, pulp mill recovery boiler including composite studs and method for protecting boiler tubes	Boiler tube studs of composite construction, particularly for protecting waterwall tubes in pulp mill recovery boilers. The studs include an inner solid cylindrical core of a material having thermal conductivity sufficient to provide proper heat transfer to the boiler tubes during operation, and an outer cylindrical sleeve of a material resistant to destructive conditions within a boiler during operation, such as chemical attack and abrasion. The sleeve surrounds the cylindrical surface of the core, but leaves an end surface of the core exposed. The core may be made of low carbon steel, and the sleeve of stainless steel. In order to avoid melting of the stainless steel sleeves when the studs are welded to the tubes, the cylindrical sleeves do not extend all the way to the attachment end such that axial gaps are defined where the sleeves do not cover the cylindrical surfaces of the cores. Compared to standard carbon steel studs, the composite studs have a much longer life before replacement is required, and yet they wear sufficiently for wear patterns to be observed as an indicator of boiler operating conditions. The composite studs maintain a cylindrical configuration as they wear, resulting in improved anchoring of a frozen smelt layer and thus protection of the boiler tubes compared to conventional studs. The composite studs are compatible with conventional studs, in the context of either studs replacement, or replacement of tubes or groups of tubes in panels, and methods of use are disclosed.

5,071,332	Sulphur granulator	Sulphur is obtained to the desired granulation and at the same time cooled by means of a directed hollow cylindrical jet of melted sulfur, on either side of which, i.e., both inside and outside the cylinder of molten sulfur, there are two jets of cold water, the jets being directed onto a disk which is able to turn freely. The jets of water and sulfur strike the disk between the middle of the disk and its outer edge and make it turn, while at the same time the sulfur hardens into granules. The turning spins the granules off the disk. The fact that there are two jets of water leads to a better particle size of the sulfur and, because there is a better contact between the water and the sulfur, prevents any hardening of the sulfur upon the disk.

4,944,867	Process to secure oil, gas, and by-products from pyrobetuminous shale and other matter impregnated with hydrocarbons	The process for obtaining oil, gas and other products from pyrobituminous shales and the like includes introducing crushed shale into a retort and contacting the crushed shale in the top portion of the retort with a stream of retort gases. Hot gases are injected at an intermediate point of the retort and a stream of cold gases are injected at the bottom of the retort. The gaseous retorted matter above the zone where the shale undergoes pyrolysis is removed and directed to a cyclone from separation of heavy liquid components from a gaseous stream. The gaseous stream is then purified and compressed with a portion of the compressed stream being heated and reinjected as the steam of hot gases into the retort. The other portion of the compressed stream of gases is cooled and a liquid component consisting primarily of water and heavy oil is separate therefrom in a spray tower. The water portion is separated from the oil and recirculated to the spray tower while a part of the oily portion is separated for resue outside the process with the remainder being recycled to the cyclone. A portion of the compressed gases from the cyclone is cooled and injected into the bottom of the retort as the stream of cold gases.

4,944,769	Process for the granulating of sulphur	Sulphur is obtained to the desired granulation and at the same time cooled by means of a directed hollow cylindrical jet of melted sulfur, on either side of which, i.e., both inside and outside the cylinder of molten sulfur, there are jets of cold water, the three jets directed onto a disk which disk is able to turn freely. The jets of water and sulfur strike the disk between the middle of the disk and its outer edge and make it turn, while at the same time the sulfur hardens into granules. The turning spins the granules off the disk. The fact that there are two jets of water leads to a better particle size of the sulfur and, because there is a better contact between the water and the sulfur, prevents any hardening of the sulfur upon the disk.

4,845,776	Piezoelectric transducer and transformer circuit	An electroacoustic piezoelectric transducer, particularly useful as a high frequency loudspeaker or tweeter, includes a concave diaphragm mounted in a housing along its periphery outwardly of a peripheral inflection region thereof. A substantially square piezoelectric bimorph element is affixed to a central region of the inner concave surface of the diaphragm by securing each of its four corners to the diaphragm. The bimorph element is directly coupled to a transformer in an electrical circuit including a low voltage AC source for applying an alternating voltage thereto. In operation when an appropriate alternating voltage is applied to the square bimorph element, in-phase vibrational displacements of the four corners thereof which are fixed to the diaphragm occur which cause the diaphragm to vibrate in its entirety about its peripheral inflection region to produce sound at an amplitude greater than the amplitude of vibration of the bimorph element. The transformer provides an increased excitation level so that the bimorph element provides good high frequency response. By virtue of the direct connection between the transformer and the piezoelectric bimorph element, the sensitivity of the bimorph element increases up to 15 db depending on the turn ratio of the transformer. The bandwidth can also be controlled in a range of between about 3 kHz to 30 kHz through suitable design of the primary inductance of the transformer.	Electro Acustica S.A.	Bittencourt; Helio T.

4,658,732	Pneumatic propulsion system for freight and/or passenger vehicles	A pneumatic propulsion system for passenger vehicles is constituted by a structural beam, composed of modular elements end-supported on pillars. The beam supports the trackway and provides an air duct for pneumatic propulsion of vehicles. A longitudinal slit in the top surface of the beam is sealed by flexible flaps and that press against each other to seal off the duct, while allowing for the passage of support mast. Airflow for propulsion of the vehicle is generated by a stationary airflow generator, which feeds the air propulsion duct by way of connecting ducts and which is outfitted with a set of four butterfly control valves that are controlled by a command and control system of flow and pressure condition in the duct which actuates the valves pneumatically, allowing automatic or manual selection of "suction" or "pressure" conditions in the duct. Shutoff valves are fitted to openings in the bottom surface of the beam to allow isolation of segments of the propulsion air duct or, alternatively, its venting to connecting ducts or to the atmosphere, allowing by means of a combination of several valves to delimit a specific propulsion air circuit. Traction of the vehicles results from the difference in pressure that is established on opposite sides of propulsion plate by the effect of the airflow generated by the generator unit. A support mast connects to a propulsion plate jointly with a traction arm which transfers the resultant tractive force to the vehicle. Adjustable decompression panels assembled on the propulsion plate assure that a maximum safe pressure differential limit is not exceeded, said limit being controlled by the action of a set of springs positioned on both sides of the propulsion plate.

4,633,694	Automatic control on strip continuous processing lines	Gradual acceleration/deceleration of continuous strip processing lines is achieved by suspending manual selected acceleration/deceleration control in favor of predetermined low acceleration/deceleration rates when the line speed is below a pre-established value. Line speed is monitored as a function of the amplitude of a control signal used to drive an amplitude-responsive, variable speed motor. The control signal is derived from an integrator used to integrate a command signal level representing the operator-selected acceleration/deceleration rate. When the control signal amplitude is below a pre-established value, a reference signal level, representing a lower acceleration/deceleration rate than that selected by the operator, is applied to the integrator in lieu of the command signal. A plurality of gradually increasing acceleration rates may be automatically effected until the speed of the continuous strip processing line achieves a pre-established level.

4,507,391	Method for detecting the presence of G.sub.D3 ganglioside	Mouse monoclonal antibody AbR.sub.24 (Dippold et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 77:6114-6118, 1980) has a high degree of specificity for human melanoma cells when tested on viable cultured cells using the PA-MHA serological assay. The antigen detected by this antibody has been isolated from melanoma cells and shown to be G.sub.D3 ganglioside by compositional and partial structural analysis and by comparison with authentic G.sub.D3 by thin layer chromatography (TLC). AbR.sub.24 reacts with authentic G.sub.D3, but not with any other ganglioside tested. Using TLC and reactivity with AbR.sub.24, a wide range of cells and tissues was examined for the presence of G.sub.D3. A new serological assay, termed glycolipid-mediated immune adherence (GMIA), was devised for assaying the reactivity of AbR.sub.24 with gangliosides. Melanomas (cultured cells or tumor tissue) were shown to have T.sub.D3 and G.sub.M3 as major gangliosides. Other cells and tissues examined also contained G.sub.D3, but usually only in low amounts. Melanomas (and MOLT-4, a T-cell line) were characterized by a simplified ganglioside profile with G.sub.D3 and G.sub.M3 as major components. The apparent discrepancy between the ubiquitous presence of G.sub.D3 and the serological specificity of AbR.sub.24 for melanoma cells can be explained in terms of localization and concentration of G.sub.D3 in different cells.

4,176,159	Process for concentration of titanium containing anatase ore	The process basically consists of the removal of the impurities contained in titanium minerals, in which titanium is present in the form of oxides in complex association with other minerals which cannot be eliminated by the conventional hydro-metallurgical processes. The conditioning of the mineral by pyro-metallurgical treatment followed by magnetic separation, removes a part of the magnetic impurities at the same time that it exposes those impurities to the action of leaching acids and thus makes it possible for them to be removed easily. The alkaline treatment following the acid leaching permits elimination of the phosphorus contained as a harmful impurity, and makes it possible to secure a product within the specifications of the consumer market for use as a raw material mainly for the obtention of pigments and metallic titanium, which are the main forms in which titanium ores enter into consumption.

4,169,723	Process of melting blast-furnace cast-iron	A method and apparatus for the continuous pouring of pig-iron from blast furnaces is described. The method is based upon the provision of a reservoir external to the furnace and spaced therefrom but connected thereto by a passageway. The reservoir of molten metal permits the storage of an amount of molten metal at a level equal to or equilibrated to the level of molten metal within the furnace resulting from the hydrostatic head of liquid produced by the molten metal within the hearth, the slag resting upon the molten metal and the solid overburden of ore within the blast furnace. The reservoir permits the continuous pouring of molten metal from the furnace by adjustment of a pouring opening thereof to a level of the reservoir equal to the level of molten metal within the furnace. Semi-continuous operation is obtained by adjusting the level of the pouring opening to levels above the level of the liquid metal within the furnace. The volume provided for the reservoir should be ample to contain the liquid metal during periods when the pouring is discontinued. When the pouring is a continuous operation the volume of the reservoir may be limited to the volume of the passage connecting the reservoir with the blast furnace.

At low to medium engine speeds, corresponding to speeds from idling to city-driving speeds, the cooling system develops a cooling power sufficient to satisfactorily cool the interior of the passenger compartment. At higher engine speeds, corresponding to highway travel, the cooling power developed by the cooling system is automatically decreased by automatically decreasing the per-cycle volumetric throughput of the cooling-medium compressor. The automatic decrease is effected in automatic response to the reaching of a certain engine rpm or a certain condensation pressure in the condenser of the cooling system. In the illustrated embodiment, the compressor is a sliding-vane compressor, and the perrotation volumetric throughput thereof is decreased by arresting certain ones of the vanes in the retracted position.

3,947,684	Scintigram display apparatus with multilevel analysis and two-dimensional interpolation	In the isocount scintiscanning, the detector probe is scanned over the object plane such that it is stopped at each observation point during the time T necessary for the input pulses to reach a preset value N. The count rate R = N/T is then calculated electronically and the two-dimensional array of said count rate R.sub.i,j, output of said isocount scanner, is read in the memory of the display system, which is the subject to the present patent. These data are read out from said memory in synchronism with the television horizontal sweep signal; each value of count rate R.sub.i,j is compared to a reference slice level a.sub.k and if R.sub.i,j .gtoreq.a.sub.k, black is assigned to the corresponding picture element on the screen; if R.sub.i,j <a.sub.k, white is assigned to the corresponding element on the screen. If said slice level a.sub.k is changed sequentially with convenient velocity, there is observed on the screen a kind of silhouette corresponding to those areas with count rate higher than the slice level a.sub.k, and said silhouette moves by changing its form. The human sensors are very keen to variations and this process makes the detection of details of the picture very easy. Moreover, a two-dimensional interpolation is employed in order to display the picture with 3 mm .times. 3 mm elements, for example, from data taken 6 mm apart. By this expedient, it is possible to compose a scintigram in a shorter scanning time, without deterioration of picture quality.
