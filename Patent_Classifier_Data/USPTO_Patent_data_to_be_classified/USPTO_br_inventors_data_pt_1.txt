A JIT accelerator selects a unique function signature that identifies the application and the user's target platform. If the signature cannot be found in a repository, indicating that the application has never been run on the target platform, the accelerator generates and stores the requested executable program in shared memory and saves the signature in the repository. The system then returns to the user a pointer to the stored platform-specific executable. If multiple users of the same platform request the same application, the system recognizes an affinity among those requests identified by their shared signature, and provides each user a pointer to the same previously stored, shared executable.

10,767,090	Method and composition for dust control	The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for treating piles of particulate materials to inhibit and prevent the loss of valuable fuel or mineral dust from being released from storage piles or open containers. The method involves applying separately to the pile two different compositions. When separate the two compositions are low viscosity and easy to spray. When combined the two form a gel coating that is resistant to erosion but is flexible while the pile or payload is still settling, jostling, being bumped, and otherwise moving around. This coating is especially effective for coal piles, iron ore piles, and also for piles within and/or being moved by open topped railroad cars. The coating's flexibility prevents the coating from becoming brittle and shattering. The coating has better performance than its ingredients do alone. As a result the invention can both prevent unwanted dust pollution as well as save its users money by avoiding loss of blown away material.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	C09K 3/22 (20060101); B05D 1/36 (20060101); B08B 17/02 (20060101); B05D 1/34 (20060101); B08B 17/00 (20060101); E21F 5/00 (20060101); E21F 5/02 (20060101); E21F 5/06 (20060101); B05D 7/00 (20060101); B05D 1/02 (20060101)

Using the planar conducting materials, once a fluid sample with suspended microparticles is applied into the channel, highly localized modulated electric field distributions are generated inside the channel and the fluid sample. This generated field causes inducing of dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces such that the DEP forces gradually increase along the length of the channel occupied by the electrodes. These DEP forces counteract the hydrodynamic drag of the flow acting on the particles suspended in the fluid. Because of the induced forces, micro/nano-particles in the fluid sample are deflected at locations in the microchannel that are a function of the particles velocity and this effect is captured by an image sensing device.

The partitions can be associated with different regions of a point cloud frame (spatial location scalability), different spatial resolutions of point cloud data (spatial resolution scalability), different reconstruction quality levels (SNR scalability), different point cloud frames organized in temporal layers (temporal resolution scalability), or different combinations of the preceding types of partitions. For decoding, a decoder can select all of the partitions or a subset of the partitions. The decoder decodes encoded data for the selected partitions, applying an inverse transform such as an inverse RAHT to transform coefficients for attributes of occupied points in point cloud data.

The request includes a vendor identifier that uniquely identifies the vendor. In response to receiving the request to access the vendor configuration information, the common vendor server identifies vendor configuration information for the vendor. The vendor configuration information is sent the common vendor application on the communication device. The common vendor application uses the vendor configuration information to customize the common vendor application specific to the vendor. This allows multiple vendors to use the same common vendor application, but to have a common look-and-feel. It also reduces the number of applications necessary to support multiple vendors.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	G06F 15/177 (20060101); H04L 29/08 (20060101)

10,448,636	Anti-resistance method	The decrease in soybean rust control using fungicide mixtures (DMAs+QoIs) reached very low levels for the harvest of 2012/13 (an average of 37% for the three main mixtures). This decrease is due to a decrease in Pp sensitivity to individual DMIs and QoIs, and mixtures thereof. Anti-resistance strategies have not been introduced in Brazil for preventing/delaying the development of resistance of the fungus that is the casual agent of rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) in soybean [plant form the family Fabaceae, Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and of the fungus that is the casual agent of yellow leaf spot (Drechslera tritici-repentis) in wheat [plant of the family Triticea, Triticum aestivum L.], as well as other disease complexes that attack the main crop plants in Brazil, such as corn, beans, cotton, inter alia. By means of said method it is possible to recover the efficiency of several mixtures (DMI+QoI and QoI+SDHI) due to a decrease in fungal sensitivity. The methods described by the present invention seek to increase the effective useful life of fungicides and increase grain yield.

10,414,505	Aircraft air conditioning system airflow regulation	An environmental control system for an aircraft uses engine bleed air for cabin environment control. The environment control system regulates the inlet airflow by assessing a plurality of parameters that provides, but not limited to, the aircraft operating conditions and external environment data, aiming at substantially reducing the extracted engine bleed air demand for cabin environment control and fuel consumption reduction and concurrently complying with aircraft pressurization, ventilation and thermal load requirements. The environmental control system airflow target is calculated based on the actual aircraft operating conditions, external environment data and a multi-dimensional airflow schedule map. Then, environmental control system airflow target is further trimmed based on the actual aircraft operating conditions and air conditioning system performance capabilities by fixing the air conditioning airflow outlet temperature and then regulating the air conditioning inlet mass airflow through the flow control valve. The first control method reduces and the second one trims the environmental control system airflow target comparing to conventional control methods. Thus, fuel consumption reduction is obtained when the environment control system airflow target (extracted bleed air demand) can be reduced and or trimmed depending on flight conditions.	Embraer S.A.

10,331,009	Compact optical key based on a two-dimensional photonic crystal with 120 degree folding	The present invention is based on a two-dimensional photonic crystal where are inserted defects that originate two waveguides and one resonant cavity. An electromagnetic signal that crosses the device is confined in the interior of the defects, due to the photonic band gap associated with the periodic structure that surrounds it. Its main function is the control of the flux of an electromagnetic signal over a communication channel, blocking (state off) or allowing (state on) the passage of the signal. It also promotes the change in the propagation direction of an electromagnetic signal by an angle of 120 degrees, providing greater flexibility in the design of integrated optical systems. The working principle of the device is based on the excitation of dipole modes in its resonant cavity, accordingly to the application of an external DC magnetic field on the magneto-optical material that constitutes it. In states on and off the magneto-optical material is magnetized and nonmagnetized, respectively.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	G02B 6/35 (20060101); G02F 1/095 (20060101); G02F 1/313 (20060101)

10,324,426	Automated system and method to manufacture aeronautic junction parts	Every junction part for an airplane wing is manufactured with overmaterial. Each part is measured with a laser based interferometer or other scanning technique and the "as built" measurements are compared with a model to generate a new trajectory milling program to fill or prevent gaps between parts using a points cloud and B-Spline algorithm to generate a new surface to be milled. Once the program is generated (new trajectories) and post processed, it is sent to a milling machine to perform overmaterial milling on already milled parts with overmaterial. This technique can be used to eliminate gaps between junction parts and the corresponding need for shims.	Embraer S.A.

10,251,140	Method and apparatus for synchronization signal transmission in a wireless communication system	In one aspect of the teachings herein, a radio network node advantageously adapts the transmission duration of a synchronization signal with respect to transmission of the synchronization signal in different directions. For example, the radio network node uses a shorter transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with better reception conditions and a longer transmission duration in beam directions that are associated with poorer reception conditions. As a consequence of varying the transmission duration according to received-signal qualities known or expected for the different directions, the radio network node can shorten the overall time needed to complete one synchronization-signal transmission cycle and use less energy, as compared to using a more conservative, longer transmission time in all beam directions.

10,223,810	Region-adaptive hierarchical transform and entropy coding for point cloud compression, and corresponding decompression	Innovations in compression and decompression of point cloud data are described. For example, an encoder is configured to encode point cloud data, thereby producing encoded data. In particular, the encoder applies a region-adaptive hierarchical transform ("RAHT") to attributes of occupied points, thereby producing transform coefficients. The encoder can also quantize the transform coefficients and perform adaptive entropy coding of the quantized transform coefficients. For corresponding decoding, a decoder is configured to decode the encoded data to reconstruct point cloud data. In particular, the decoder applies an inverse RAHT to transform coefficients for attributes of occupied points. The decoder can also perform adaptive entropy decoding and inverse quantization of the quantized transform coefficients. The adaptive entropy coding/decoding can use estimates of the distribution of values for the quantized transform coefficients.

10,072,358	Process for recycling composite materials	The present patent of invention describes a recycling process to recover fibrous reinforcing material of composite materials, particularly carbon fiber, primary reactor compound (101), for the controlled pyrolysis and oxidation of the composite material matrix (resin) at low temperature (400.degree. C. to 500.degree. C.) and a system for treating waste gases produced by thermal decomposition of composite material matrixes which employs a secondary reactor (201), containing within the same a thermal plasma arc (211). The main characteristic of the process, within the scope of the carbon fiber recycling, is the possibility of maintaining the fabric web, obtaining fabrics made of pure carbon fiber, without a significant amount of residues and preserving their structural characteristics. The thermal plasma allows managing high temperatures (2,000.degree. C. to 15,000.degree. C.) in a controlled atmosphere, which allows the dissociation of long chains of molecules into ions that are recombined to produce combustible gases and other acid or alkaline gases that are easily neutralized and retained in gas cleaning systems.

9,955,480	Method and apparatus for resource allocation satisfying multiple performance constraints	A low-complexity, efficient Radio Resource Allocation method performed by a base station of a wireless communication network allocates a first plurality of frequency resources among a second plurality of requesting mobile terminals. Each mobile terminal employs a service such that two or more services are represented in the second plurality. The RRA method satisfies all of an exclusivity constraint that each frequency resource is allocated to only one mobile terminal, an adjacency constraint that all frequency resources allocated to any given mobile terminal are contiguous in a frequency domain, and a minimum service requirement constraint that a predetermined number of the mobile terminals employing each service be granted a required data rate. The RRA method comprises two phases: Unconstrained Maximization and Reallocation. In the Unconstrained Maximization phase, frequency resources are iteratively allocated to mobile terminals in an opportunistic way, obeying the exclusivity and adjacency constraints but without concern for the minimum service requirement constraint; the resulting allocation is tested for fulfillment of the minimum service requirement constraint; and one or more mobile terminals are removed from the allocation based on the minimum service requirement constraint test. In the Reallocation phase, frequency resources from one or more mobile terminals that have their required data rate fulfilled are reallocated to one or more mobile terminals that do not have their required data rate fulfilled.

9,926,761	Advanced automated control system for minimizing slugging	Slugging of fluids produced in petroleum wells creates major disturbances for production rigs, and leads to major variation in process pressures and levels. In many cases, these disturbances cause unscheduled production stops, and in others may damage equipment such as heat exchangers. Thus slugging may have a major impact on the reliability of the operation, as it may affect product availability and quality (BSW, TOG and Moisture). Therefore, there is a complex control problem to use measurements to dynamically act on the production choke valves to set a new type of flow, without major slugging. The purpose of this invention is to provide an Advanced Automated Control System for minimizing slugging that can quickly act to avoid this type of flow as well as protect the process equipment. This system is comprised of sensors, valves and numerous PID or ONFC type controllers using aggregate computer algorithms to monitor a set of operating variables that enable diagnosing and controlling production well slugging. This advanced control system is efficient and eliminates or minimizes slugging during production well operation.
