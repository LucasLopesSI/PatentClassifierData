The apparatus is characterized by comprising a set of cells (21) of piping being electrical conductor or not, separated by electrical insulating joints (10A), but hydraulically interconnected to form sections (22) arranged or connected in series. The apparatus has an electrical arrangement that allows the direction of the magnetic field generated by the current passing through the insulated electric wire, which goes inside the pipe, be added to the direction of magnetic field generated within the pipe. The result of the sum of these magnetic and electrical fields is a tangential reinforced force. The reinforced resultant has helically--centrifuged form with direction to the inner wall of the tube (which carries lots of electrons). These electromagnetic forces push bacteria to the inner tube surface. These forces stress the membrane of these microorganisms and generating pores in the membrane, which eventually causes total lysis.

10,100,803	Ocean wave-crest powered electrical generator in combination with pumped storage	An ocean wave-crest powered electrical generator comprises a buoyant vessel anchored to the sea floor by mooring chains. The vessel defines a substantial opening at the bow leading to a paddle wheel such that ocean wave crests flow past the paddle wheel while passing through the generator thereby capturing the power of the continuous wave crests passing through the bow opening. The paddle wheel transforms energy from the breaking wave crests into kinetic energy that in turn activates an electric power generator. The wave crest electrical generator is permanently moored near the beach and allowed to rise and fall with the tide thus allowing for a continuous flow of ocean waves to be converted into power. Pumped storage provides a sustained flow of energy that is easy to regulate and this can be accomplished in combination with "energetic marinas" by constructing a reservoir on top of a near-by cliff, hill or tall building.

8,485,220	Automatic flow regulator valve	An automatic flow regulator valve designed to regulate water pressure from a liquid source outlet in the event of pressure surges and/or fluctuations. In an "open" position, the predetermined water flow pressures are not sufficient to overcome a spring force of a spring. Therefore, a sealing plate is maintained separated from a step by the spring force, thus allowing water to flow around the outmost perimeter edge of sealing plate. In operation under water flow pressure surges and/or fluctuations, the automatic flow regulator valve is "closed". In the "closed" position, the water flow pressure surges and/or fluctuation pressures are sufficient to overcome the spring force of spring. Therefore, the sealing plate is biased against the step and the water does not flow around the outmost perimeter edge of sealing plate since sealing plate is biased against the step.

7,980,494	System for recycling of HDPE from motor-oil containers	The present invention provides an integral system for recycling post consumer motor-oil plastic containers. Oils and especially motor-oil, physically attaches to its HDPE (high density polyethylene) containers demanding a unique recycling process. As described by this patent, oil-contaminated plastic containers are thermally drained and mechanically freed from their labels and aluminum sealing rings. Unlabeled containers are further shredded through oil-free flake-cutting process, in which, plastic melting is minimized, thus preventing oil to be trapped inside the plastic structure. A hot water bath of sulfonic acid and/or detergents, containing the shredded flakes, is subjected to a very high turbulence in the absence of air (water sealed), which induces liquid cavitation. High rotational turbulence combined with cavitation impacts (generated by fast evaporation/condensation/implosion) supply enough surface energy to liberate the strongly attached oil molecules, which are further trapped by the detergent bath. The bath can be regenerated indefinitely. Centrifugation of the washed flakes, hot and cold water rinsing and further hot-air drying, complete the process before re-pelletizing industrial quality HDPE with the full characteristics of new material.

7,754,842	Elastomeric polymers	Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) has been utilized in the synthesis of carbosilane and carbosiloxane polymers bearing a latent reactive methoxy-functional group on each repeat unit. The polymerization results in a linear thermoplastic polymer. The latent reactive methoxy groups remain inert during polymerization; however, exposure to moisture triggers hydrolysis and the formation of a chemically cross-linked thermoset. The thermoset's properties can be modified by varying the ratio of carbosilane and carbosiloxane repeat units in the final material. Also, increasing cross-link density by using cross-linkable chain-end groups and increasing the run length of the soft phase, maximizing phase separation and elasticity, allows for the synthesis of elastic thermosets exhibiting good tensile strength. Adding a trifunctional ADMET active chain-end cross-linker to the system improved the mechanical behavior of the resulting polymer.

7,420,025	Elastomeric polymers	Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) has been utilized in the synthesis of carbosilane and carbosiloxane polymers bearing a latent reactive methoxy-functional group on each repeat unit. The polymerization results in a linear thermoplastic polymer. The latent reactive methoxy groups remain inert during polymerization; however, exposure to moisture triggers hydrolysis and the formation of a chemically cross-linked thermoset. The thermoset's properties can be modified by varying the ratio of carbosilane and carbosiloxane repeat units in the final material. Also, increasing cross-link density by using cross-linkable chain-end groups and increasing the run length of the soft phase, maximizing phase separation and elasticity, allows for the synthesis of elastic thermosets exhibiting good tensile strength. Adding a trifunctional ADMET active chain-end cross-linker to the system improved the mechanical behavior of the resulting polymer.

7,381,802	Human antibodies that specifically recognize the toxin Cn2 from Centruroides noxius scorpion venom	The present invention is directed to recombinant human antibodies specific for Cn2 toxin from C. noxius scorpion venom. The antibodies are able to recognize the toxin and preferably neutralize it as well as the whole venom of C. noxius scorpion. This invention is also directed to a human non-immune phage display library. One clone that specifically binds the Cn2 toxin was affinity matured by directed evolution. Three cycles of maturation were performed and several scFv clones were isolated which specifically recognize toxin Cn2 with increased Kd of 446 fold. All variants were monomeric and only variants 6009F, 6105F and 6103E showed to be capable of neutralizing toxin Cn2 and the whole venom. Variant 6009F recognizes a different epitope than that of BCF2, a murine monoclonal antibody raised against scorpion toxin Cn2 which is also capable of neutralizing both Cn2 toxin and the whole venom when tested in mice, as well as that of commercially available polyclonal antibody fragments antivenom from horse. The scFv 6009F is the first reported recombinant human antibody fragment capable of neutralizing a scorpion venom. These results pave the way for the generation of safer autologous recombinant neutralizing antivenom against scorpion stings. The antibodies of the present invention can be used as part of a composition to treat those in need of treatment including those already stung by one or more scorpions, particularly C. noxius scorpions.

7,035,042	Fast positioning of disk drives and other physical systems	A method useful to change a system's output from one value to another within a prescribed time-interval in an optimal manner using optimization criteria such as minimal time (e.g., to increase throughput) or minimal energy (e.g., to reduce heat dissipation and reduce induced vibrations). Optimal design of maneuvers (such as fast seek and scanning) that rapidly change the output from one value to another, arise in flexible structure applications, including rapidly positioning the end-point of large-scale space manipulators, positioning of read/write heads of disk-drive servo systems, which are relatively medium-scale flexible structures, and nano-scale positioning and manipulation using relatively small-scale piezo actuators. Maintaining a position of an element constant outside of the transition time-interval is critical in many applications. For example, in disk-drive applications, read and write operations cannot be performed (before and after the output transition) if the output position is not precisely maintained at a desired track.

6,131,224	Coupling device for transfer between a static structure and a dynamic structure	An improved coupling device for the transfer of personnel or objects between a static and a dynamic structure, such as between an offshore platform and a support vessel, which has two trunnion assemblies and a connecting bridge operating such that the dynamic structure is free to pitch, roll, and move in the horizontal plane with very little of this motion being translated to the connecting bridge. Also, any vertical motion of the dynamic structure, such as rising and falling over waves, is transformed and reduced by an order of magnitude in the same timeframe, when translated to the connecting bridge. Support is provided to one end of the connecting bridge by a trunnion assembly attached to a static structure. This trunnion assembly allows the connecting bridge to rotate around the Y and Z axes relative to the static structure, in a motion similar to a turntable arm. The other end of the connecting bridge is supported by a second trunnion assembly which remains in contact with the dynamic structure and absorbs its pitch, roll, and motions in the horizontal plane, while translating very little of this motion to the connecting bridge. This allows both personnel and objects to be transported between structures in rough seas at times when such transfer might ordinarily be precluded.

5,928,129	Apparatus and method for performing presbyopia corrective surgery	A process for surgically correcting presbyopia includes anesthetizing a patient and marking a portion of an eye of the patient which is to be ablated. At least a portion of the cornea is resected to expose the corneal stroma. An annular portion of the corneal stroma is then ablated using radiation from a laser beam. After ablation, the cornea is repositioned onto the eye. The cornea may be resected such that a portion of the cornea remains intact, and is folded back to expose the corneal stroma. Alternatively, a complete disk of the cornea may be removed from the eyes to thereby expose the corneal stroma. After exposure but before ablating, the corneal stroma should be dried to prevent uneven ablation which may occur if fluids are present on the stroma. The laser beam may be directed in a circular fashion until an annular ablation is formed, or a mask may be provided over a central area of the corneal stroma. To prevent edema, the ablated portion should be cleaned by brushing and irrigating. A system for surgically performing the presbyopia correction process also is described.

5,807,979	Synthetic, three-dimensionally stabilized polypeptide mimics of HIV	Methods for synthesizing three-dimensional stabilized peptides which mimic the three-dimensional configuration of the active site of a natural, biologically active protein are carried out by (1) noting the three-dimensional configuration of the active site of a known biologically active protein (2) noting the amino acid sequence and the hydrogen bonds existing between amino acids which hydrogen bonds are capable of maintaining the three-dimensional configuration of the active site and (3) producing a synthetic three-dimensional peptide to mimic the structure of the active site. The synthetic peptide is synthesized so as to have the same or a similar amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence of the active site of the biologically active polypeptide but with the stabilizing hydrogen bonds being replaced by a bridging divalent radical selected from the group of --(N)--C(CH.sub.3).dbd.N(H.sup.+)--CH.sub.2 --(N)--; --(N)--C(CH.sub.3).dbd.N(H.sup.+)--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --(N)--; and --(N)--N.dbd.CH--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --(C)--. The stabilized three-dimensional peptide obtained is then isolated from the reaction mixture. The invention makes it possible to produce a wide range of biologically active compounds which have stable three-dimensional structures which allow the compounds to be used to obtain, for example, stabilized three-dimensional peptides which mimic the antigenic sites on viral envelopes which are useful as vaccines.

5,491,861	Portable, demountable bridge of aerial point to ford rivers, chasms and the like	A portable, demountable bridge which can be self-launched. The bridge uses a traditional beam system to conform the deck of the bridge. Two hollow, bottom-plated, triangular footings are added as supports for this beam. These footings, buried into the soil of a riverbank or the bank of a chasm, absorb the horizontal forces using the weight of the soil above the bottom plates of the footings. Sets of vertical plane trusses parallel to the axis of the deck and located on each side of the deck at the entrance, help the beam of the deck to support vertical loads, by means of a transversal truss which touches the beam of the deck at its upper chord. Each set of the additional vertical plane trusses are founded on two bottom plated footings buried into the riverbank or the bank of a chasm. The footing near the water uses the soil as a bearing, and the other footing is used as a counterweight. The bridge also uses the soil of the riverbank or bank of the chasm as a protection against floods. Preferably, all elements of the bridge are pin connected. The unions assure the theoretical requirements for obtaining simple stresses in the elements. The bridge is provided with U-shaped protection railings which use a spring, anchored to the deck, as a shock absorber.	February 20, 1996	Penuela; Julio P.

Alternatively, the arrays may be placed in a planar configuration on opposing sides of the patient area. Either a three-dimensional image or a two-dimensional image can be formed from a patient's body placed within the patient area. Moreover, the edges between the arrays of crystals are offset in relation to the edges between the light detectors, allowing use of circular photomultiplier tubes instead of the more expensive square photomultiplier tubes. Each light detector is suitably positioned adjacent four adjacent quadrants of four respective arrays to detect radiation emitted from the four quadrants of each array. According to one aspect of the present invention, the crystals within the arrays are selectively polished and selectively bonded to adjacent crystals to present a cross-coupled interface which can tunably distribute light to adjacent light detectors. According to another aspect of the present invention, the crystal arrays are formed by optically bonding slabs of crystals (which may be optically treated for light control) into a "pre-array" and then cross-cutting the "pre-array" from one or more sides to form the final array. The grooves may be optically treated, such as with white reflective fillers, for further optical control within the array.

5,138,010	Fast switching polysiloxane ferroelectric liquid crystals	New ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) materials comprising linear and cyclic polysiloxanes are described. The FLCs exhibit high polarization and fast switching speeds. The disclosed polysiloxanes are derivitized with mesogenic groups which induce high polarization, specifically chiral nonracemic epoxide mesogens, having phenylbenzoate, reverse phenylbenzoate and biphenyl cores. These epoxy polysiloxanes are chemically stable over extended periods. Further, the epoxides can be crosslinked to produce FLC elastomers and like materials having optoelectronic applications. It was found that in the pure polysiloxanes, the smectic layers align along the rubbing direction of an anisotropic surface on contact with that surface. An unexpected alignment transition is observed as a function of polysiloxane concentration in polysiloxane/LC monomer mixtures with smectic layers orienting along the rubbing direction at high polymer concentrations and, typical of low molecular weight liquid crystals, normal to the rubbing direction at low polymer concentrations. A method for alignment of FLC polysiloxanes is described. The aligned polysiloxane FLCs and FLC mixtures exhibit high contrast electro optic switching.

5,027,650	Method for characterization of adhesion between hard materials	A microscratch-test method for measuring adhesion between a first material and a second material adhered to one another at an interface and forming an article. The method involves polishing a planar surface of the article generally normal to the interface and exposing the interface and the first and second materials. A static load of predetermined mass is applied to a starting point on the first or second material in a direction generally normal to the planar surface, using a load means of a third material harder than the first and second materials. The load means is moved across the planar surface from the starting point in a straight line generally toward and across the interface at an angle relative to the interface of between 90.degree. and about 20.degree.. These steps are repeated, varying the mass. The starting point for each repetition is spaced apart from other starting points but is approximately equidistant with other starting points from the interface. The lowest value of the predetermined mass is observed at which a predetermined level of damage to one or more of the interface, first material, and second material occurs. The scratch angle may be constant or may vary with each repetition.	July 2, 1991	Oblas; Daniel W. (Bedford, MA), Sarin; Vinod K. (Lexington, MA), Sanchez; Jaime (Medellin, CO), Sivo; Frank E.

4,515,450	Transparency for use with a flying spot scanner to generate images	A transparency that is used in a flying spot scanner to generate imagery for simulated flight contains a rectangular center section and eight peripheral sections, four of which lie along the side boundaries of the center section, while the remaining four are at the corners of the center section such that their edges are contiguous to the edges of the side peripheral sections. Each of the nine sections is laid out such that corresponding terrain features lie along opposite margins. This coupled with the fact that all nine sections are identical enables all of the sections to blend together into a mosaic so that the section boundaries within the interior of the mosaic are barely, if at all, discernible. As a consequence, the terrain pattern along any boundary of the center section is repeated along the opposite boundary. A projected raster moves essentially within the center section in response to commands issued from a simulated cockpit. Whenever the projected raster reaches one of the boundaries for the center section, it indexes instantaneously to a corresponding point on the opposite boundary and thereafter continues generally in the same direction of advance. Since the terrain features are identical at the two boundaries, the change is imperceptible, and accordingly, the imagery that is observed from the cockpit gives the illusion of continuous flight.

4,502,647	Tape attached sensor	A method and system for detecting tape attachment to a machine reel of an automatically threading magnetic tape system. During the threading process, a file reel is rotated to allow a sufficient length of tape to be unwound therefrom, which length of tape eventually attaches to the machine reel after being automatically threaded through the desired tape path. The rotation of the file reel is maintained during this threading process by delivering current pulses to a file reel motor. These current pulses are counted per unit time. As soon as the tape attaches to the machine reel, the machine reel begins to pull the tape from the file reel, thereby eliminating the need to deliver current pulses to the file reel motor, at the same rate as needed prior to tape attachment. A change in the rate of the current pulses delivered to the file reel motor signals a tape attached condition.	March 5, 1985	Zweighaft; James (Boulder, CO), Georgis; Steven P.

4,496,419	Fine line patterning method for submicron devices	A technique for fine line patterning for submicron devices is disclosed. A fine line pattern is defined on a positive resist, which is then developed to expose corresponding portions of a mask layer. The pattern is then transferred to the mask layer to produce an oxidation mask which is used to control local surface oxidation of an underlying metal film, such as aluminum. The selectively oxidized aluminum film is then etched, leaving a patterned Al film corresponding to the initial positive pattern, since the etch rate of oxidized Al film is much less than the etch rate of the unoxidized Al film. The patterned film may be the final desired device structure, or may serve as a mask for pattern transfer to an underlying substrate.	January 29, 1985	Nulman; Jaime (Cali, CO), Krusius; J.
