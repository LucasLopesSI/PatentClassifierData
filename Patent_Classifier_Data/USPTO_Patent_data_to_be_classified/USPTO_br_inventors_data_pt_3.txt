8,580,512	Yeast-based methods of identifying nucleic acids and compounds for treating neurodegenerative diseases	The disclosure encompasses methods for the screening of small molecules or nucleic acids that may reverse the inhibition of growth of the unicellular yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by rotenone. The use of a yeast as the screening target allows for the high-throughput screening of small molecule and nucleic acid libraries for candidates that may then be screened in animal models as therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The plant-derived isoflavonoid, rotenone, while only moderately inhibitory to S. pombe cell growth on complex rich medium, is highly inhibitory to growth on synthetic minimal medium. S. pombe cells carrying a deletion in the gene pmk1 are hypersensitive to rotenone. S. pombe, therefore, provides a model for elucidating complex 1-independent targets of rotenone, and can serve as a screening tool for identifying compounds or oligonucleotides potentially able to reverse the effects of rotenone or Parkinson's disease in animal or human subjects.

The present invention provides alternative arrangements for the heat exchanger system in order to use the thermal potential of the post-adsorption stream with the elimination or minimization of the risk of a slug flow regime in the exchangers, the so-called "gush," which would be a natural result from the periodic oscillation characteristic of PSA processes. With this, the vapor consumption with the modified process according to the present invention is considerably reduced.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	B01D 53/02 (20060101)

Depending on the data available, this process may be carried out in a sequential manner by obtaining and combining additional dynamic data at selected areas. Through this process, multiple realizations of the properties of the geological formation (within the geological structural model) may be created based from the pressure-data conditioned geostatistics i.e. geostatistics that have been informed by data from both static and dynamic sources. Finally, the dynamic simulation of models should be compared to the results of the lumped average parameter estimation to provide a final calibration of the created models.

8,409,647	Silica microgels for reducing chill haze	The present invention provides a method of reducing chill haze in a protein containing liquid (especially beverages resulting from fermentation such as beer and wine) by contacting the liquid with silica microgels having an average microgel diameter of at least 18 nm, more preferably at least 45 nm, and most preferably at least 70 nm. It has now been discovered that microgels having an average microgel diameter of less than about 18 nm do not adequately reduce chill haze of a protein containing liquid. In particular, while microgels having an average microgel diameter of less than about 18 nm cause the coagulation of haze-forming components, these components remain suspended in liquid and continue to cause haze despite allowing the liquid to settle for long periods of time. Conversely, it has now been discovered that microgels having an average microgel diameter of at least about 18 nm cause the coagulation and precipitation of haze-forming components and the rapid settling thereof without the use of an organic polymer which acts as a flocculating agent.

8,333,179	Method for taking the outgassing of fuel from the engine oil of an internal combustion engine into account	The invention deals with a method for operating an internal combustion engine with engine oil as the lubricant, wherein a fuel mass flow outgassing from the engine oil is ascertained and is taken into account via a map-based pilot control during the metering of a quantity of fuel supplied to the internal combustion engine and wherein a fuel/air ratio supplied to the internal combustion engine is determined. Provision is made in the method according to the invention for a mass flow offset determined from the deviation of the fuel/air ratio supplied to the internal combustion engine from a nominal value to be taken into account when the metering of the quantity of fuel supplied to the internal combustion engine occurs during an effective duration of the map-based pilot control. The mass flow offset takes the deviation into account, which remained after the correction by a map-based pilot control of the quantity of fuel metered, on the basis of the modeled outgassing of fuel from the engine oil, and said mass flow offset balances the lambda controller in this way. The mass flow offset can by way of example have the effect of shortening the duration injection. The mixture deviations as a result of different boiling curves of the components of the fuel blend, which cannot be completely taken into account by the map-based pilot control under all operating conditions of the internal combustion engine, can in this way be compensated.

8,295,151	Method central unit, and modem in a digital subscriber line network	A method, central unit, and modem for reducing crosstalk in a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) system. A virtual line referred to as a ghost line is introduced in the system as a substitution for all of the lines except a first line to induce crosstalk to the first line. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) on the first line is allocated to optimize against the ghost line. A modem on the first line reports to a central Spectrum Management Center (SMC), a measure indicating crosstalk impact from the ghost line. This process is repeated for each line. The SMC calculates updated ghost line parameters for each line, which reflect current crosstalk characteristics between each modem and the remaining modems, and sends the updated parameters to the modems. The modems then reallocate PSDs with respect to the updated ghost line parameters to either maximize the rate or minimize the power on their respective lines.

8,123,167	Impact resistant aircraft leading edge structures and aircraft including the same	Aircraft empennage structures have impact resistance satisfying transport aircraft certification requirements (for example, FAR part 25 and/or other international certification requirements). The structures may be specifically embodied in leading edge structures that are preferably in the form of one-piece components formed from fiber-reinforced composite materials (e.g., reinforcement fibers such as glass fibers, aramid fibers and/or carbon fibers embedded in a polymeric matrix such as an epoxy resin). The leading edge structures will most preferably include an arcuate skin and longitudinally extending internal reinforcement which is generally Y-shaped and includes a planar rib element and a pair of planar divergent reinforcement arms. The rib element may be positioned so as to be coplanar with a longitudinal bisecting plane of the leading edge structure. A forward end of the rib element may thus be integrally attached aft of an apical end of the skin, whereas an aft end of the rib may be integrally attached to each of the reinforcement arms. According to certain embodiments, rigidity and thus impact resistance may be facilitated by providing the apical end of the skin with a greater cross-sectional thickness as compared to the attachment ends of the skin.

7,984,880	Mechanisms and methods for providing rudder control assist during symmetrical and asymmetrical thrust conditions	Rudder assist mechanisms and methods are capable of being operably connected to an aircraft's rudder control system. The rudder assist mechanisms most preferably have over-the-center spring biasing functions so as to cause either substantially no spring force (i.e., when the linkage is over the spring-bias center) or substantially all spring force (i.e., when the linkage is left or right of the spring-bias center) to be exerted on the rudder control system. The rudder assist mechanism may include a control spring assembly, and a linkage assembly which operably connects the control spring assembly to the rudder control assembly. The linkage assembly is moveable operably between a null position wherein substantially no spring force of the control spring assembly is transferred to the rudder control system by the linkage assembly, and right and left spring-biased positions wherein right and left spring forces of the control spring assembly are transferred to the rudder control system, respectively. The null position may therefore establish a dead zone of rudder deflection within a selected range of right and left rudder control surface deflection angles. Thus, right and left spring forces may be transferred to the rudder control system when the rudder control surface is deflected at an angle which exceeds the selected range of deflection angles. Some embodiments include an actuator unit which is operably capable of moving the spring assembly and the linkage assembly connected thereto between a thrust symmetrical mode (TSM) condition and a thrust asymmetrical mode (TAM) condition so as to cause different spring forces to be exerted on the rudder control system in such different thrust conditions.

7,843,231	Temperature-compensated voltage comparator	A temperature-compensated voltage comparator (301) that compares first and second input voltages includes first and second bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) (221 and 222) that convert the first and second input voltages to first and second input currents, respectively. The first and second BJTs share a same thermal environment and their currents are dependent upon temperature. A temperature-compensating circuit (350), which includes a zero thermal coefficient reference (419), generates a logarithmic temperature-compensating factor that compensates for temperature dependency of the first and second BJTs. The temperature-compensating circuit receives one of the input currents, and outputs a temperature-compensated current that is said input current multiplied by the logarithmic temperature-compensating factor. The temperature-compensating circuit shares a thermal environment with the first and second BJTs. An output voltage is indicative of a differential between the first input voltage and the second input voltage, such that a threshold of the comparator is substantially temperature independent.

7,732,664	Genes associated to sucrose content	Modern sugarcane cultivars are complex hybrids resulting from crosses among several species of the Saccharum genus. Traditional breeding methods have been extensively employed in different countries along the past decades to develop varieties with increased sucrose yield, and resistant to plagues and diseases. Conventional varietal improvement is, however, limited by the narrow pool of suitable markers. In this sense, molecular genetics is seen as a promising tool to assist in the process of molecular marker identification. The present invention concerns the identification of 348 genes associated with sucrose content in sugarcane plants. The genes were found to be differentially expressed when high sucrose and low sucrose plants and populations of plants were compared and/or when high and low sucrose internodes were compared. The expression data was obtained using cDNA microarray and quantitative PCR technologies. The genes identified can be used to identify, distinguish, characterize and/or develop plants with increased sucrose content. More preferably SEQ ID Nos: 1 to 203 should be useful as molecular markers. SEQ ID Nos: 204 to 228 are given as controls or examples of genes never associated with sucrose content. SEQ ID Nos. 1-203 and SEQ ID Nos. 229 to 373 can be targeted in the development of transgenic or non-transgenic varieties with increased sucrose content.	Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP.

When inserted into the filler port, the nozzle is brought into contact with the protective device which serves to deflect the nozzle in laterally (e.g., in an inboard direction) to thereby prevent the nozzle from striking the lower wing skin. Thus, when initially inserted into the filler port in a generally perpendicular orientation relative to a horizontal plane, the terminal end of the nozzle will contact with the arcuately concave inner surface of the device such that continued insertion of the nozzle into the filler port will cause the nozzle to assume an angularly canted condition in an inboard direction (i.e., a direction toward the aircraft's fuselage).

7,698,846	Owner recognition by portable guns	The invention presented in this work creates the possibility of a portable gun--revolver, pistol, carbine, riffle or hand-machine gun, to recognize its owner, in progressive levels of handling safety. Three levels of handling safety are established based on the evaluation of the grip force or its effect through material deformation or strain gage measurement. The first level of handling safety does not allow persons with grip force bellow a given limit, to shoot with a gun. The second level of handling safety enables the portable gun to recognize an individual as belonging to a smaller group than the first level. Now, the gun will only recognize for a successful firing an individual whose grip force, measured by one strain gage, fit into a small operational range, established and stored at the moment of acquisition by the owner. The third level of handling safety enables a portable gun to recognize an individual, as belonging to an even smaller group than in the second level. In practice this group is unitary and is composed by the person that grasped the handle to establish the average local grip forces, measured by six strain gages, at the acquisition moment.

7,691,768	Additive to maximize GLP and propene suitable for use in low-severity operations of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and its preparatory process	A process for the preparation and modification of additives, with a zeolite base and a high silica alumina ratio (SAR) like the ZSM-5, to increase the yield of propene and LPG in low severity FCC operations, that seeks to maximize the production of medium-distillates with low aromaticity and to minimize molecular cracking in the LCO range. The additives involved guarantee an increase in light olefin yields without altering the yield or the quality of the LCO produced. The innovative process includes surprising actions from rare earths (RE) on the active sites of zeolite, that at once partially block their pores and, in this way, make molecular cracking in the medium-distillate range difficult, which preferably occur at low reaction temperatures and keeps the remaining sites quite active. These sites are sufficiently active to crack smaller molecules in the gasoline range, guaranteeing an overall increase in light olefins and allowing the additive involved to be used industrially in operations to maximize medium-distillates in an FCC unit. This new additive may be obtained by modifying any commercial ZSM-5 zeolite additive.

7,391,901	Method for embedding color image information into a black-and-white image	A method is disclosed for converting color images to textured monochrome images such that image regions with similar luminance but different chrominance look different when converted to black-and-white to preserve color information therein. This texture-encoded color information can be extracted at a later time to reconstitute the original color image. The present method involves first converting the color image to a luminance-chrominance colorspace. The chrominance data is decomposed into 4 channels of chrominance. A wavelet transformation of the luminance channel is preformed. Scaled chrominance channels are then mapped to a number of wavelet sub-bands. Once mapped, the wavelet transform is inverted to generate textures proportional to the original colors of the color image having an amplitude proportional to the chroma of the original color. The black-and-white image is embedded with this texture information into the image's grayscale component. In order to retrieve the color image from the textured grayscale image, a wavelet transform regenerates the scaled chrominance channels mapped therein. Those wavelet sub-bands comprising embedded chroma are extracted and scaled to the size of the original image. The remaining sub-bands are inverted to produce the Y-image thereof. Separate images now exist in Y, Cr, and Cb. The recombination of the YCbCr images produce the colored image that was previously embedded into the grayscale components of the textured black-and-white image.

The LEM implements a static solution for elastic global deformations of objects filled with fluid based on the Pascal's principle and volume conservation. The volumes are discretised in long elements, defining meshes one order of magnitude smaller than meshes based on tetrahedral or cubic elements. The LEM further combines static and dynamic approaches to simulate the same deformable medium, allowing modeling a three-dimensional internal state at any point inside the deforming medium from a reduced number of explicitly updated elements. Complex elastic and plastic deformations can be simulated in real time with less computational effort. The LEM is particularly useful in real time virtual interactions, soft tissue modeling, and graphic and haptic rendering.

7,113,540	Fast computation of multi-input-multi-output decision feedback equalizer coefficients	Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) Optimal Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) coefficients are determined from a channel estimate h by casting the MIMO DFE coefficient problem as a standard recursive least squares (RLS) problem and solving the RLS problem. In one embodiment, a fast recursive method, e.g., fast transversal filter (FTF) technique, then used to compute the Kalman gain of the RLS problem, which is then directly used to compute MIMO Feed Forward Equalizer (FFE) coefficients g.sub.opt. The complexity of a conventional FTF algorithm is reduced to one third of its original complexity by choosing the length of a MIMO Feed Back Equalizer (FBE) coefficients b.sub.opt (of the DFE) to force the FTF algorithm to use a lower triangular matrix. The MIMO FBE coefficients b.sub.op are computed by convolving the MIMO FFE coefficients g.sub.opt with the channel impulse response h. In performing this operation, a convolution matrix that characterizes the channel impulse response h extended to a bigger circulant matrix. With the extended circulant matrix structure, the convolution of the MIMO FFE coefficients g.sub.opt with the channel impulse response h may be performed easily performed in the frequency domain.

Then, one of at least two different GCR functions are selected where the selection is based on the state of the received information bits. The number of GCR functions to be selected from is dependent on the number of possible states of the information bits intended to be encoded at each image pixel and preferably equals the number of states of the information bits intended to be encoded at each image pixel such that the GCR spatially varies across the output image. Further, at least two GCR functions are optimized to carry information and information bits intended to be encoded within the output image are represented with a tag. CMYK values are then generated using the selected GCR function and the color values. These CMYK values are assigned to a corresponding pixel in the output image. The information bits to be encoded at a given pixel indicate the type of object to which that pixel belongs, such as: graphics, picture, text, line art, etc. The output image, when printed, exhibits the property that substantially similar colors occurring at different spatial locations in the input image are produced with substantially different CMYK combinations in the print. Preferably, a parameterized function is used for the GCR function and the encoded state sets the parameter of the function. Information bits should be redundantly encoded throughout the output image. Regions that cannot be encoded by GCR information have to be compensated for. A reference mark is applied on the output image to indicate the starting point and order of the information sequence.

Multi-component data is obtained from the formation layer. An initial value of horizontal and vertical resistivity can be determined by using a whole space model and assuming an isotropic layer. Revised values of the vertical and horizontal resistivities are obtained through a first and second inversion process. A first inversion is performed on the horizontal resistivity, holding a value of vertical resistivity constant. A second inversion is performed on the vertical resistivity, holding a value of horizontal resistivity constant. These inversions are iterated until a desired convergence is achieved.
