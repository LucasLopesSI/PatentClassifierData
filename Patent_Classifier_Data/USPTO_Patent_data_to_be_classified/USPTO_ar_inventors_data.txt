10,498,462	Tap centerer method and structure for coherent optical receiver	A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.	INPHI CORPORATION	Hueda; Mario R.

10,335,600	Cardiac device for treating Brugada syndrome	Brugada syndrome and related forms of ion channelopathies, including ventricular asynchrony of contraction, originate in the region near the His bundle or para-Hisian regions of the heart. Manifestations of Brugada syndrome can be corrected by delivering endocardial electrical stimulation coincident to the activation wave front propagated from the atrioventricular (AV) node. By performing the start of the activation of the HIS bundle or para-Hisian region early enough, electrical stimulation can be delivered fast enough to compensate for the conduction problems that start in those region, such that the activation wave front, as stimulated, transitions from the AV node to the His bundle in a normal, albeit electrically-supplemented, fashion. This stimulation not only helps resolve the conditions that trigger Brugada syndrome, but also resolves the asynchrony of the contraction of the heart.	NEWSTIM, INC.

10,326,533	Reduced complexity constrained frequency-domain block LMS adaptive equalization for coherent optical receivers	A method and structure for equalization in coherent optical receivers. Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.	INPHI CORPORATION	Hueda; Mario R.

10,128,959	Tap centerer method and structure for coherent optical receiver	A method and structure for tap centering in a coherent optical receiver device. The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.	INPHI CORPORATION	Hueda; Mario R.

Asynchronous equalization helps to reduce complexity and power dissipation, and also improves the robustness of timing recovery. However, conventional devices using inverse interpolation filters ignore adaptation algorithms. The present invention provides for forward propagation and backward propagation. In the forward case, the filter input signal is forward propagated through a filter to the adaptation engine, while, in the backward case, the error signal is backward propagated through a filter to the asynchronous domain. Using such forward and backward propagation schemes reduces implementation complexity while providing optical device performance.	INPHI CORPORATION	Morero; Damian A. (Cordoba, AR), Hueda; Mario R.

9,966,966	Nonlinearity induced synchronization enhancement in mechanical oscillators	An autonomous oscillator synchronizes to an external harmonic force only when the forcing frequency lies within a certain interval, known as the synchronization range, around the oscillator's natural frequency. Under ordinary conditions, the width of the synchronization range decreases when the oscillation amplitude grows, which constrains synchronized motion of micro- and nano-mechanical resonators to narrow frequency and amplitude bounds. The present invention shows that nonlinearity in the oscillator can be exploited to manifest a regime where the synchronization range increases with an increasing oscillation amplitude. The present invention shows that nonlinearities in specific configurations of oscillator systems, as described herein, are the key determinants of the effect. The present invention presents a new configuration and operation regime that enhances the synchronization of micro- and nano-mechanical oscillators by capitalizing on their intrinsic nonlinear dynamics.

The pharmaceutical combination described in this invention exhibits lower toxicity compared to that reported by the anticancer therapeutics and therefore, it represents a crucial advantage for its use in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the sequential administration of this pharmaceutical combination through the pretreatment with the P15 peptide leads to the chemo sensibilization of refractory tumors to the anticancer therapeutics.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	A61K 38/04 (20060101); A61K 31/69 (20060101); A61K 31/675 (20060101); A61K 45/06 (20060101); A61K 33/24 (20060101); A61K 31/555 (20060101); A61K 38/08 (20060101); C07K 7/00 (20060101); A61K 31/5377 (20060101); A61K 31/513 (20060101); A61K 31/506 (20060101); A61K 31/475 (20060101); A61K 31/704 (20060101); A61K 31/337 (20060101); A61K 31/407 (20060101)
9,225,433	Timing recovery for optical coherent receivers in the presence of polarization mode dispersion	A receiver architecture and method performs timing recovery in the presence of differential group delay (DGD) (caused, for example, by polarization mode dispersion). A matrix-based linear transformation is applied to the polarization components of a signal received over the optical fiber channel that mitigates or eliminates the effects of the differential group delay. Timing recovery can then be performed on the transformed signal to recover a clock signal. Beneficially, the described technique can recover timing information even in half-baud DGD channels. Furthermore, latency and computational load can be minimized.	ClariPhy Communications, Inc.

8,622,612	Method and apparatus for determining the thermal expansion of a material	A focus error signal resulting from the photothermically-induced expansion is measured in a sample of material under analysis. A laser is disposed as a periodically modulated heating source which is directed to the sample and a device for focus error measuring which is directed to the surface being heated. A device measuring focus error generates a signal representative of the displacement of the surface of material in perpendicular direction due to the expansion produced by the periodic heating, which is filtered, either analogically or digitally, to discriminate the displacement component at the frequency in which it was modulated or at any other related frequency, such any harmonic or a sum with any other modulation. The focus error signal, appropriately calibrated, gives a precise and sensitive measure of the magnitude the expansion. Said magnitude and its dependence with the modulation frequency allows the determination of physical properties such as the thermal expansion or thermal diffusivity coefficient, the thickness of a coating film or the absorption coefficient of the light from the heating beam. By varying the wave length of the directed radiation it is possible to determine the absorption spectrum of the sample even for very small sized particles in which the fraction of absorbed energy is very little.

At the time, the system presents strong barrier for going through the information by means of other technological resources (of optical nature, for example) due to the impossibility of knowing the chromatic parameters settings involved in the scanning procedure for each cluster, which can change from one bit to another one. At the same time, the physical access results also impossible because of the destruction of the support that would be done in the will of doing it. The data clusters are characterized by the particular bias introduced at the constitutive patterns of the electromagnetic waves projected through the chromatic deposits at the molecular level of the support, which read by a proper scanner are after processed and assigned to data categories. Those inputs categories, finally produce outputs for interfaces and external requirements.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	G06K 7/10 (20060101)

7,910,231	Preparation and properties of Cr-C-P hard coatings annealed at high temperature for high temperature applications	Chromium plating from the trivalent state is relatively environmentally friendly as compared to a hexavalent chromium bath. Incorporation of non-metallic and metalloid elements into the coating should lead to enhanced properties. The relationship between composition, structure, and properties of annealed Cr--C--P layers electrodeposited from chromium-based trivalent baths is discussed. These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.

7,884,602	Nuclear magnetic resonance evaluation using independent component analysis (ICA)-based blind source separation	Disclosed is a non-lineal statistical independent component (ICA) analysis methodology for calculating T2 or T1 distributions of nuclear magnetic resonance logs. In one aspect, the invention employs a classical blind source separation (BSS) approach with the input data (T2 or T1 distributions) being considered not only horizontally (in relaxation time units), but also vertically (in depth). The statistical variations are used for separating the principal independent components and their corresponding weighting matrix. The result of such ICA based BSS is an efficient separation of T2 components correlative to the presence of particular conditions (e.g., clay bound water, heavy oil, capillary bound water, free water, mud filtrate (water and oil), and noise). Individual saturation of estimated fluids can be calculated from the weighting matrix generated in accordance with the invention. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, it is contemplated that independent component analysis techniques may be applied to the underlying time domain data prior to its transformation to a T2 distribution. This advantageously results in "de-noising" of the signal, leading to more precise and accurate results following analysis of the T2 distribution.

7,846,474	Use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta	This procedure consists in the first stage, of the administration of enough quantity of bisphosphonate preparation during the necessary period of time to acquire a degree of volumetric mineral density of the cortical tissue of application, within the normal range (average.+-.1 DS). Then the administration of the bisphosphonate preparation is interrupted in order to enable the development of the sectional momentum of inertia. The length of the second stage can be determined by means of a tomography. That is to say, that the periods of administration or non-administration of the mineralizing agent are defined or controlled by precise osteologic variables and therefore are not fixed. If during the second stage the cortical mineral density drops by 6-10% of the maximum value previously obtained, administration of bisphosphonate preparation should be resumed until the corresponding maximum adjusted value is reached again. The proposed procedure of a period with bisphosphonate followed by another period without the bisphosphonate agent improves fracture resistance, provided that the length of both periods is controlled by defined osteologic variables.

7,065,511	Non-linear dynamic predictive device	A non-linear dynamic predictive device (60) is disclosed which operates either in a configuration mode or in one of three runtime modes: prediction mode, horizon mode, or reverse horizon mode. An external device controller (50) sets the mode and determines the data source and the frequency of data. In the forward modes (prediction and horizon), the data are passed to a series of preprocessing units (20) which convert each input variable (18) from engineering units to normalized units. Each preprocessing unit feeds a delay unit (22) that time-aligns the input to take into account dead time effects. The output of each delay unit is passed to a dynamic filter unit (24). Each dynamic filter unit internally utilizes one or more feedback paths that provide representations of the dynamic information in the process. The outputs (28) of the dynamic filter units are passed to a non-linear approximator (26) which outputs a value in normalized units. The output of the approximator is passed to a post-processing unit (32) that converts the output to engineering units. This output represents a prediction of the output of the modeled process. In reverse horizon mode, data is passed through the device in a reverse flow to produce a set of outputs (64) at the input of the predictive device. These are returned to the device controller through path (66). The purpose of the reverse horizon mode is to provide information for process control and optimization. The predictive device approximates a large class of non-linear dynamic processes. The structure of the predictive device allows it to be incorporated into a practical multivariable non-linear Model Predictive Control scheme, or used to estimate process properties.

6,864,228	Use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta	This procedure consists in the first stage, of the administration of enough quantity of bisphosphonate preparation during the necessary period of time to acquire a degree of volumetric mineral density of the cortical tissue of application, within the normal range (average IDS). Then the administration of the bisphosphonate preparation is interruption in order to enable the development of the sectional momentum of inertia. The length of the second stage can be determined by means of a tomography. That is to say, that the periods of administration or non-administration of the mineralizing agent are defined or controlled by precise osteologic variables and therefore are not fixed. If during the second stage the cortical mineral density drops by 6-10% of the maximum value previously obtained, administration of bisphosphonate preparation should be resumed until the corresponding maximum adjusted value is reached again. The proposed procedure of a period with bisphosphonate followed by another period without the bisphosphonate agent improves fracture resistance, provided that the length of both periods is controlled by defined osteologic variables.

6,802,197	Process for manufacturing a high strength container, particularly an aerosol container, and the container obtained through such process	A process for shaping a high strength container, particularly an aerosol container and a container obtained through such process. Generally, aerosol containers made of aluminum or tin are obtained by conventional embedding processes from sheet disks and have cylindrical bodies with upper tapering finishing at a curl for fixing a valve cover and are closed by convex and profiled cross section bottoms, for forming a support region for upstanding the container. The bottom of such containers is obtained before tapering by means of a blow or front shock once the cylindrical body having planar circular base is shaped, this impact causing undesirable stresses on the body side wall and material accumulation at the annular region joining with this wall since the bottom thickness is not uniform. The invention proposes a process for shaping this kind of containers by extrusion thus saving material as a consequence of imparting the container with thin walls due to a substantial change in the production concept, giving concave shape to the base for avoiding undesirable stresses on side wall during further production steps and saving material at the joints with the side wall. The invention also relates to a particular shape container, having no material accumulation at the concave bottom, which may be used in different positions, horizontal or vertical aided by plastic or metal accessories.

6,674,291	Method and apparatus for determining and/or improving high power reliability in thin film resonator devices, and a thin film resonator device resultant therefrom	The effects of electromigration have been shown to lead to damage of metal electrodes of electronic devices such as thin film resonator (TFR) devices in only a few hours, for a test input power that is within the operational range of these devices. It has been determined that this failure is sensitive to the frequency of the input power. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for determining high power reliability in electronic devices, so as to enable an accurate determination of the failure time of the electronic device, and hence projected lifetime. This determination is independent from the frequency of an input power applied to the electronic device as part of the method for testing the device. Based on the above results, a TFR device has been developed, which includes a protective or electromigration-reducing layer such as titanium being deposited atop an electrode of the device. The TFR device with the modified electrode structure can operate at higher power levels and has a longer operational lifetime than what is currently available.	Agere Systems Guardian Corp.

6,673,013	Surgical instruments and procedures for stabilizing the beating heart during coronary artery bypass graft surgery	Methods and devices used to stabilize a beating heart during a surgical procedure on the heart and to expose a surgical site are disclosed. The stabilizing device is introduced through an opening through the chest and brought into contact with the beating heart, and by exerting a stabilizing force on the device, the motion of the heart caused by the contractions of the heart muscles is effectively eliminated. Exposure members are actuable to reposition a portion of the surface of the heart to better expose a target artery or other surgical site. Accordingly, the heart is stabilized and movement of the site of the surgery is minimized. Typically, in separate steps, a surgeon contacts the heart with the stabilizing device, assesses the degree of movement of the anastomosis site, and exerts a force with a stabilizing device such that the contractions of the beating heart causes only minimal excess motion at the surgery site, whereupon exposure members further reposition heart tissue to better expose the surgical site. The stabilizing device may be attached to a rigid support or may be attached to a semi-rigid support which is rendered motionless mechanically, chemically or by human intervention.

6,609,361	Primary frequency regulation method in combined-cycle steam turbines	A method to provide Primary Frequency Regulation to a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that comprises storing energy in the form of internal energy of the steam contained within the piping and domes of the heat recovery boilers, and then using said energy when the power grid requires a sudden increase in output power. With the present method, the losses in power generation of the steam turbine, when said turbine is operating in the Primary Frequency Regulation mode, are reduced to a minimum. When the gas turbines in a combined cycle plant operate in PFR mode, the steam turbine reduces its output power because the gas turbines must operate below their rated power. The present method converts said decrease in output power of the steam turbine in a Spinning Reserve useful for PFR in said turbine. That is to say that the present method converts said Spinning Reserve in a rapid reserve, available after just a few seconds; if necessary, response times of less than 10 seconds can be attained. The present method introduces several novel steps, which constitute its essence, said steps permitting the continuous, long term operation of the steam turbine in a combined cycle plant in PFR mode, thereby ensuring at any time the effectiveness of mains frequency regulation and also guaranteeing the stability of the power generation process in said combined cycle plant.

6,460,282	Hammer mechanism for firearms	My invention is a new and improved hammer mechanism which reduces the strength of the hammer mainspring without also reducing the hammer's strike force. My invention comprises a link mechanism integrally assembled to the hammer of a firearm. The link mechanism moves at a positive velocity relative to the hammer as the hammer itself moves from the "cocked" position to the striking position. Both the hammer and the link mechanism are biased into the striking position by the hammer mainspring with a section of the link mechanism protruding from the front surface of the hammer and impacting the firing element of the firearm or primer. The link mechanism thus impacts the firing element or primer at a velocity and force roughly equal to the aggregate velocities and forces of the hammer and the link mechanism. In the preferred embodiment, the link mechanism comprises a first and second cavities within the hammer, each cavity having a plunger slidingly disposed therein and each plunger biased within its corresponding cavity by a spring. As the hammer mainspring biases the hammer into the striking position, it also concurrently biases the two sets of plungers and springs within the cavities thereby enabling a section of one of the two plungers to protrude from the hammer front surface and impact the firing element or primer. The invention may be installed as a substitute for and improvement over prior art hammer mechanisms.		Bustos; Alfredo A.

6,431,078	Autonomous transport system	An autonomous transport system is disclosed, formed by four main subsystems: a channel subsystem; a vehicle subsystem; a wheel guide subsystem and central control station subsystem. The system is designed for the transportation of people or goods, to be used in tall buildings and in small and large scale urban environments. It comprises unitary vehicles that may move in different directions: horizontal, steeply sloped and also vertical tracks, thanks to novel traction wheel assemblies that roll on carefully designed wheel tracks. The system's cabin maintains the horizontal level/position regardless of the changes of track direction or slanting thanks to pendulum based automatic level control and may rotate up to 180.degree. under normal conditions and even a full 360.degree. turn respect to the wheel assembly in space restricted positions. The cabin is mounted on a cantilever, thereby displacing its center of gravity respect of the wheel guides. Thus, a lever action is established, which presses the wheels against the wheel tracks and therefore enough frictional resistance is obtained so as to avoid wheel slippage on the wheel tracks. The vehicles are moved by non-polluting, electric drives that move and stop them with high energy savings. The vehicle runways are designed taking in account safety features against fire hazards. Several vehicles may be used at the same time and on the same track and may run individually or in groups, conforming a train. The system allows for vehicles to be parked in bypassed positions or else they may be disengaged from the convoy to be used individually.

6,213,941	Surgical instruments for stabilizing the beating heart during coronary bypass graft surgery	The invention is methods and devices which a surgeon may use to stabilize the beating heart during a surgical procedure on the heart. Pursuant to the invention, a stabilizing device is introduced through an opening in the chest and brought into contact with the beating heart. By contacting the heart with the device and by exerting a stabilizing force on the device, the motion of the heart caused by the contraction of the heart muscles is effectively eliminated such that the heart is stabilized and the site of the surgery moves only minimally if at all. Typically, in separate steps, the surgeon contacts the heart with the stabilizing means, assesses the degree of movement of the anastomosis site, and exerts a force on the stabilizing means such that the contraction of the beating heart causes only minimal excess motion at the surgery site. By fixing the position of the stabilizing means in a configuration where the motion of the beating heart is effectively eliminated, the surgeon is able to stabilize the beating heart for the duration of the procedure. The stabilizing means may be attached to a rigid support or may be attached to a semi-rigid support which is rendered motionless mechanically, chemically, or by human intervention. In certain preferred embodiments, the stabilizing means is affixed to a semi-rigid support which is caused to become rigid, by any of a variety of techniques, such that the position of the stabilizing means becomes fixed by the support, and the heart remains substantially motionless for the duration of the procedure.

6,182,013	Methods and apparatus for dynamically estimating the location of an oil-water interface in a petroleum reservoir	Methods for locating an oil-water interface in a petroleum reservoir include taking resistivity and pressure measurements over time and interpreting the measurements. The apparatus of the invention includes sensors preferably arranged as distributed arrays. According to a first method, resistivity and pressure measurements are acquired simultaneously during a fall-off test. Resistivity measurements are used to estimate the radius of the water flood front around the injector well based on known local characteristics. The flood front radius and fall-off pressure measurements are used to estimate the mobility ratio. According to a second method, resistivity and pressure measurements are acquired at a variety of times. Prior knowledge about reservoir parameters is quantified in a probability density function (pdf). Applying Bayes' Theorem, prior pdfs are combined with measurement results to obtain posterior pdfs which quantify the accuracy of additional information. As new measurements are acquired, posterior pdfs, updated for expected temporal variations, become prior pdfs for the new measurements. According to a third method, uncertainty about the reservoir parameters is represented by Gaussian pdfs. The relationship between measurements and reservoir parameters is locally approximated by a linear function. Uncertainties are quantified by a posterior covariance matrix.

This mechanism includes connecting rods mounted on eccentric wheels, which are in turn connected to the elbow of the crankshaft. Due to this special disposition, these rods do not move in the traditional oscillating manner but only in linear form. Each connecting rod and its piston are cast as a single, light metal piece, without the use of connecting pins. The piston length need not be greater than strictly necessary for holding the ring. The connecting rod length is also reduced. The distance from the crankshaft axis to the cylinder-head union is not bigger than half that now typically in use. The crankshaft length is less than half the length of traditional ones. All this allows, in its use in an internal combustion engine, better thermal and mechanical efficiency, optimization of the relative weight/power and extends the engine's lifetime.

6,069,314	Emitter of ions for a lightning rod with a parabolic reflector	A lightning rod is enshrouded by a large number of electrically isolated metallic points. When a storm cloud passes overhead, a charge is induced in the lightning rod, causing the metallic points positioned near the lightning rod to emit sparks, causing the air about the points to become ionized. These produced ions are accelerated by an electric field produced by two metallic plates, one being electrically connected to the induced charge in the lightning rod and the other being electrically isolated from the charge induced in the lightning rod. The acceleration of the produced ions is strong enough to produce more ions through an avalanching effect created when ions collide with other air molecules in the presence of the strong electric field. This large multiplicity of ions is transported by the electric field set up by the accelerator and guided by a collimator into the atmosphere surrounding the lightning rod apparatus to attract a lightning strike, thus protecting a larger area from the damaging effects of lightning strikes.

6,050,266	Procedures for stabilizing the beating heart during coronary artery bypass graft surgery	The invention is methods and devices which a surgeon may use to stabilize the beating heart during a surgical procedure on the heart. Pursuant to the invention, a stabilizing device is introduced through an opening in the chest and brought into contact with the beating heart. By contacting the heart with the device and by exerting a stabilizing force on the device, the motion of the heart caused by the contraction of the heart muscles is effectively eliminated such that the heart is stabilized and the site of the surgery moves only minimally if at all. Typically, in separate steps, the surgeon contacts the heart with the stabilizing means, assesses the degree of movement of the anastomosis site, and exerts a force on the stabilizing means such that the contraction of the beating heart causes only minimal excess motion at the surgery site. By fixing the position of the stabilizing means in a configuration where the motion of the beating heart is effectively eliminated, the surgeon is able to stabilize the beating heart for the duration of the procedure. The stabilizing means may be attached to a rigid support or may be attached to a semi-rigid support which is rendered motionless mechanically, chemically, or by human intervention. In certain preferred embodiments, the stabilizing means is affixed to a semi-rigid support which is caused to become rigid, by any of a variety of techniques, such that the position of the stabilizing means becomes fixed by the support, and the heart remains substantially motionless for the duration of the procedure.

5,894,843	Surgical method for stabilizing the beating heart during coronary artery bypass graft surgery	The invention is methods and devices which a surgeon may use to stabilize the beating heart during a surgical procedure on the heart. Pursuant to the invention, a stabilizing device is introduced through an opening in the chest and brought into contact with the beating heart. By contacting the heart with the device and by exerting a stabilizing force on the device, the motion of the heart caused by the contraction of the heart muscles is effectively eliminated such that the heart is stabilized and the site of the surgery moves only minimally if at all. Typically, in separate steps, the surgeon contacts the heart with the stabilizing device, assesses the degree of movement of the anastomosis site, and exerts a force on the stabilizing device such that the contraction of the beating heart causes only minimal excess motion at the surgery site. By fixing the position of the stabilizing device in a configuration where the motion of the beating heart is effectively eliminated, the surgeon is able to stabilize the beating heart for the duration of the procedure. The stabilizing device may be attached to a rigid support or may be attached to a semi-rigid support which is rendered motionless mechanically, chemically, or by human intervention. In certain preferred embodiments, the stabilizing device is affixed to a semi-rigid support which is caused to become rigid, by any of a variety of techniques, such that the position of the stabilizing device becomes fixed by the support, and the heart remains substantially motionless for the duration of the procedure.

5,736,346	Induction of the acrosome reaction to evaluate the fertilization capability of mammalian sperm using a dendrimer sugar conjugate	A method of evaluating the in vitro or in vivo fertilization capability of a given sperm sample. The method involves the steps of capacitating a sample of mammalian sperm cells followed by incubating the capacitated sperm with a predetermined amount of a glycoside-macromolecule conjugate such as a neoglycoprotein or a glycodendrimer for a period of time and under conditions sufficient to induce an acrosome reaction in the sperm. This step effectively mimics the physiological reaction that occurs in vivo between a sperm and an egg. The extent of the conjugate-induced acrosome reaction in the sperm cells relative to a positive control and a negative control, which account for the percent of sperm in the sample that acrosome react non-physiologically and spontaneously, respectively, is then calculated. The fertilization capability of the sperm is then evaluated as a function of the extent of this calculation. Also disclosed are kits which contain the necessary materials for conducting the method in a clinical laboratory.

5,694,199	Method and apparatus for performing automated vision performance tests	An improved visual performance tester is provided which measures and stores very precise information concerning the visual sensitivity of a human eye, by use of a series of contrasting images on a computer monitor screen under a controlled-lighting environment. The tester measures the time it takes for a human patient to give the answers required by the test, thereby providing more accurate information than previously available in conventional vision testing systems. Various charts having different spatial frequencies (i.e., different sizes of bands inside a circle), different band inclinations, and different contrast characteristics are periodically displayed on the computer monitor, while the patient presses buttons (or areas) on the monitor screen to indicate his or her ability to perceive the chart images. By gradually and randomly decreasing the contrast, and/or increasing the spatial frequency, the tester can determine the patient's critical vision threshold. The test conditions are normalized in order to better compare one test result to another so that a database of "standard" human eye vision data can be accumulated for future use. After a database is established for a particular testing system, the results for an individual patient can automatically be compared to "normal" results, and the testing system's overall results in diagnosis of vision problems are superior in accuracy, precision, and range of parameters automatically measured and evaluated.

5,686,894	Two terminal I.C. magnetic-field detector for use in a liquid level sensor and having an anti-slosh feature	A two-terminal integrated circuit magnetic-field detector, for use in detecting a low level of a liquid in a vehicle, has a Hall element, a Schmitt type comparator, an anti-sloshing accumulator such as an up-down counter, and a latching driver all connected in tandem. The anti-sloshing accumulator is for producing a signal that is the integral as a function of time of the binary comparator output signal. During sloshing, when the average liquid level is near that at which a low-level warning signal is desired, the accumulator signal climbs in a vacillating manner. The latching driver is connected across the two integrated circuit (I.C.) terminals and latches on when the accumulator signal reaches a predetermined value, dropping the impedance across the two I.C terminals. A liquid level indicating lamp is connected in series with a source of DC voltage and the two I.C. terminals, so that when the average position of the floating magnet approaches that of the I.C. detector, the driver latches on and the low-level indicating lamp is also turned on and cannot be turned off except by removing the DC energizing voltage. The accumulator may be an up-down counter with means for preventing counting in the over-flow mode, and also for preventing counting in an under-flow mode, namely downward counting below zero count.

5,579,861	Power steering casing capable of operating in a power-assist mode and also capable of operating in a strictly mechanical mode	A power steering casing capable of operating in a power-assist mode and also capable of operating in a strictly mechanical mode. The power steering casing includes an inner cylinder where there is disposed a piston affixed to an end of a rack bar. The rack bar projects outside of the steering casing for connection to steering linkage of the vehicle. The steering casing is in communication with a valve which controls the passage of a power-assistance fluid in response to turning of a steering wheel. The valve comprises a jacket and a valvular nucleus. The valvular nucleus is connected to the vehicle's steering column, while the jacket is connected to a bushing on the pinion. The pinion meshes with the rack bar. The bushing is connected, via an anchorage piece and pin, to a torque bar that coaxially extend through the valvular nucleus from the bushing to the steering column. Relative rotation of the valvular nucleus with respect to the valvular jacket permits hydraulic fluid to flow through the casing and thereby provides power assistance to the steering effort. Such relative rotation between the valvular nucleus and the jacket is selectively prevented by a blocking dowel which selectively locks the torque bar, via its anchorage piece, to the bushing and valvular nucleus so that all of these elements rotate together for direct transmission of steering wheel rotation to the pinion of the rack bar. The blocking dowel selectively prevents the relative rotation in response to vehicle speed and the amount of torque on the steering wheel.	Trinter S.A.C.I.F.	Ballester; Adrian J.

By reversing the headstock of the peristaltic pump, and modulating the speed of rotation, the peristaltic pump both injects and aspirates the site. The aspirated fat and tissue is kept in a closed cycle so that contamination is minimized and exposure to the air by the fat is prevented; thereby permitting the aspirated fat to be used elsewhere for body contouring.

5,471,122	DC-motor bridge driver with end-of-braking detector	A full-bridge driver, and especially an entirely integrated bridge driver, for driving DC motors in either direction is capable of automatically braking the motor when the motor direction is to be reversed. The bridge circuit is of "H" configuration and has four transistor switches connected in bridge configuration and has two bridge output terminals to which a motor may be connected. A differential window comparator has the input connected to the two bridge output terminals, producing a high level binary signal only when the voltage across the two output terminals is within a small voltage range centered at about zero volts. A pulse-width filter circuit having an input connected to the window comparator produces a high binary output signal only when the comparator-produced binary signal remains high for greater than a predetermined time. The effect of the pulse-width filter in combination with the window comparator is to ignore the first occurrence during braking of zero motor voltage, and to recognize the second occurrence of zero motor voltage which indicates the end of the braking period at which time the motor has stopped, after which the motor can be operated in the reverse direction without creating large transient transistor and motor currents during such a transition of motor running direction.

5,469,095	Bridge circuit for driving an inductive load with a shoot-through prevention circuit	A bridge circuit, intended for use as a PWM driver of an inductive load, includes at least one source driver transistor connected in series totem-pole fashion with a sink driver transistor. A base resistor is connected from base to emitter of one of the driver transistors. This totem pole circuit is connected across a pair of DC supply conductors. A protective fly-back diode is connected across the one driver transistor. An auxiliary resistor is connected from the base of the auxiliary transistor to the emitter of the one driver transistor. When a fly-back diode across the one driver transistor conducts, the one driver transistor tends to conduct in the reverse direction and to store charge that in a subsequent period leads to shoot-through currents through the source and sink drivers. The auxiliary transistor turns on only when the fly-back diode conducts and shunts the base-collector of the source transistor, preventing its turning on and storing charge, and thus preventing potentially damaging shoot-through current through the driver transistors. The added auxiliary components do not cause additional power being drawn from the supply source, and therefore do not cause additional heating in the integrated circuit in which the bridge circuit may be formed. A pair of such half wave totem pole circuits may be paralleled to form a full wave bridge.	Allegro Microsystems, Inc.

5,457,364	Bridge motor driver with short-circuit protection and motor-current limiting feature	A full-wave bridge driver has four driver transistors. A motor is connected to the output terminals of the bridge. A fault detector latches off the four driver transistors when the bridge current jumps essentially instantaneously to exceed a predetermined safe-peak value due to a fault occurring in the bridge. A comparator has a predetermined current threshold, that is less than the predetermined safe-peak value of the fault detector, and is connected to a bridge-current sensing resistor for, when the bridge current exceeds the current threshold, producing a signal proportional to the difference between the bridge current and the current threshold. A pulse-width-modulator is connected to the comparator means output, and during periods such as at motor starting when the bridge current gradually exceeds the comparator threshold value, chops the signal at the bases of the four driver transistors, varying the chopped pulse widths to hold the motor current at essentially the threshold current value. For faults that occur across the motor or between the motor and either of the DC-supply terminals, the fault current paths in the bridge do not flow through the inductance of the motor and produce a sharp rising bridge fault current that is essentially transparent to the pulse width modulator which clamps high motor start currents at a level below that at which the fault detector trips the latch and shuts off the driver transistors.

5,447,493	Tumescent lipoplastic apparatus	An improved medical tool which combines tumescent anesthetic solution with lipoplastic. Using a peristaltic pump and a cannula, the surgeon directs the tumescent solution into the area of concern. The tumescent solution provides both a local anesthetic as well as a vasoconstrictor. The solution eliminates the need for a general anesthetic, thus eliminating problems associated therewith, and the solution causes the blood vessels to constrict, reducing the amount of blood loss during the procedure. Once the solution has had an opportunity to perform its function, the surgeon reverses the direction of the peristaltic pump and removes the fat and tissue through the same cannula used for the tumescent portion of the operation. Since the suction process is performed by the peristaltic pump (as opposed to manually by the surgeon), the cannula is reduced in size to a highly versatile and tactile instrument providing highly improved results.

The body portion includes two monolithic, contiguous amorphous silicon regions. A first region is doped to be of a first conductivity type, and a second region is an intrinsic region. The applied forward bias voltage must be greater than the flat band voltage of the detector and sufficient to bias the detector into the space charge limited regime so that charge carriers, injected at the first electrode, are blocked by a potential barrier formed near the interface between the first and the second regions. When an ionizing particle penetrates the detector, the hole (or electron) formed thereby moves towards and modulates the potential barrier to allow previously blocked charge carriers to pass over the barrier, to move across the detector and to be collected by the second electrode to provide an enhanced signal in response to the ionizing particle. The ratio of carriers, so produced, to ionizing particles (i.e. the gain) can exceed 1000.	Pennsylvania State University	Fonash; Stephen J.

5,320,393	Refuse collecting device	An improved device for collecting refuse by using a fixed holding member and moveable expander to releasably hold a bag open by virtue of tension forces exerted across the mouth of the bag. A paddle, spring-loaded to a closed position across the mouth, can also be hingedly rotated to an open position and held in the open position by a trigger. When an animal owner desires to have the paddle scoop refuse into the bag, he can manually move the trigger. This action releases the spring-biased paddle which then rotates under spring bias, scooping refuse before it, to the closed position. The scooped refuse, because of the propelling movement of the paddle's rotation, is thrown on into the bag. A moving mechanism, which is also spring-biased, can both cock the paddle in the open position and also release the bag. As the moving mechanism pulls the paddle toward the open position, a latch pin connected through a cable to the paddle is caught and held by the trigger. The moving mechanism can then return to its normal resting position under the action of spring bias, while the paddle remains in the caught, cocked position. When it is desired to release the paddle, the trigger is manually depressed and the paddle returns under spring-bias to its normally closed position.	Panagra Incorporated	Cortinas; Alfredo I.

5,179,949	Cardiac pacemaker with automatic A-V programming for optimization of left heart A-V interval	A dual-chamber AV sequential pacemaker with the capability of automatically adjusting right heart AV interval to optimize left heart AV interval by compensating for pacing-induced inter-atrial and inter-ventricular conduction delays. Depending on the pacing and sensing action, as determined by the patient's native rate, the predetermined threshold rate and intrinsic AV interval, the pacemaker selects the AV interval. Right heart AV interval is adjusted to compensate for the heart's inter-atrial and inter-ventricular delays. Threshold values are previously estimated, using mean values measured using non-invasive techniques. The pacemaker has a dual phase operating mechanism consisting of an analysis phase followed by a pacing phase. The P wave rate is sensed and compared to a predetermined base rate. If the sensed P wave rate is above the baseline, atrial depolarizations will be sensed by the pacemaker and small number (default=4) of consecutive native AV intervals will be averaged. If this average is less than a predetermined threshold value, the system will continue in the demand mode, sensing P and R waves. If the average is greater than said value, then the ventricle is paced for n number of times the analysis phase (default=100 cycles), each followed by a short AV delay (Default=50 ms) that is intended to compensate for the delay introduced in the onset of left ventricular depolarization after pacing the right ventricular apex. When P wave rate is below the predetermined rate, atrial pacing will occur.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	A61N 1/368 (20060101); A61N 001/368 ()

5,072,682	Sailboat with a pivoted mast-to-hull mounting system	Substantial improvements in design, cost, performance, safety and comfort could be had in sailboats if the hull were to navigate in a level attitude even under strong wind conditions. This is achieved by the present invention by virtue of the mast pivoting on the hull along a longitudinal axis of the vessel. In this way the wind pressure on the sail generates a forward component and a lateral component, the former being the useful wind force which the mast transmits through the pivot to the hull of the boat to propel it. The lateral component, which in conventional fixed-mast boats causes the hull to list depending on the wind direction and force, is not transmitted by the pivot to the hull but causes the part of the mast holding the sail to tilt leeward about the pivot. In order to counter the lateral wind force the invention further provides a counterweight joined to the bottom part of the mast, below the pivot, to generate a resisting torque which balances the mast at an appropriate angle depending on wind conditions. Preferably, the counterweight is situated underwater and is shaped to hydrodynamically complement the underwater surface of the hull. The conventional keel may be dispensed with or substantially reduced. The invention is also applicable to catamarans wherein the mast may be mounted to pivot in the middle of the structure supporting the pair of hull floats.		Rodriguez Urroz; Augusto C.

5,046,567	Adiabatically induced ignition of combustible materials	A method and apparatus for achieving adiabatic heat ignition of combustible material, particularly explosive compositions which involves entrapping a quantity of gas in a chamber which is in communication with the combustible material and suddenly compressing the gas to the extent that the temperature thereof is increased adiabatically to the ignition temperature of the combustible material. The apparatus is particularly adaptable for use as an adiabatic ignition device for detonating cord and shaped charges of perforating guns for completion of wells. A quantity of high explosive within an explosive barrel is in detonating proximity with the detonating cord. A cylinder forms an air chamber which is in communication with the explosive composition and is provided with a piston for compression of the gas. One or more shear pins or other locking devices are provided to secure the piston in immovable relation with the cylinder. A force is caused to act on the piston which force is typically induced by fluid pressure within the well which acts on the piston and which may also be induced. As this force reaches a predetermined magnitude, or by means of a weight bar dropped or lowered on wireline from the surface, the piston will be released and the force will drive the piston into the cylinder, compressing the gas sufficiently to raise the temperature of the gas adiabatically to the ignition temperature of the explosive composition.

4,865,036	Antitachyarrythmia pacemaker using pre-ejection period to distinguish physiologic from pathologic tachycardia	A cardiac stimulator apparatus for effecting cardioversion or defibrillation in the event of pathologic tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in which the rate of heart depolarization signals is compared to a predetermined heart rate value indicative of the onset of tachycardia while, simultaneously, the heart's pre-ejection period is monitored to sense whether an increase in heart rate above the predetermined value is accompanied by a decrease in the pre-ejection period. If not, a pathologic rather than a physiologic episode is diagnosed and a cardioversion pulse protocol is initiated. By also monitoring the mechanical pulse of the heart, if an inordinately high heart rate is accompanied by a low or non-existing mechanical pulse, ventricular fibrillation is diagnosed and the cardioverter is triggered to shock the heart back into sinus rhythm. If the mechanical pulse rate tracks the electrical rate of depolarization, tachyarrythmia is confirmed. The diagnosis may be further confirmed by taking into account the rate at which the heart rate increases.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	A61N 1/39 (20060101); A61N 1/365 (20060101); A61N 001/36 ()

Such corrected signal is used in a feedback loop to control the voltage signal provided to the tube grid in a manner causing the pulsed output current of the tube to have a preestablished amplitude. The signal correcting circuit includes a .pi.-shaped network formed of a capacitor and first and second transistors. The two transistors are connected in electrical parallel so that between pulses of the offset voltage signal the first one of the transistors is held off and keeps the second transistor turned on so that the capacitor charges to the negative offset voltage of the offset voltage signal. During the pulses of the offset voltage signal, the first transistor is turned on and thereby turns the second transistor off, causing the capacitor output side to provide a zero offset voltage pulse having an amplitude equal to the sum of the negative offset and positive voltages (the total peak-to-peak voltage) of the voltage offset signal. The zero offset signal is used by a control loop circuit and a grid pulse modulator to provide a control voltage signal to the grid of the tube which maintains the pulsed output current of the tube at a preselected level in spite of tube aging and thermal effects which tend to cause the output current to change.

4,657,763	Combined chrysotherapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases	Lysosomal enzymes and superoxide radicals (O.sub.2.sup.-) are potent mediators of rheumatoid inflammation. It is known that gold sodium thiosulphate (GTS), an injectable gold compound, inhibits lysosomal enzymes activity without however affecting its release, whereas auranofin (AF), an oral gold compound, inhibits such release but not enzyme activity. And while AF inhibits the generation of O.sub.2.sup.-, GTS is without significant effect. It has been discovered, using O.sub.2.sup.- production as an indicator of respiratory burst, that subtherapeutic concentrations of the oral gold having only partial inhibitory activity on O.sub.2.sup.- production, give rise to greatly enhanced inhibitory activity in such production when the oral gold is functionally combined with the otherwise inactive injectable gold. The effect of this combination of drugs is synergistic in that it far exceeds the sum of the individual inhibitory activities of the oral and injectable gold compounds. A further increase in O.sub.2.sup.- production inhibition is realized by adding to the combination of gold compounds hydroxychoroquine, an anti-malarial agent.	Ebert; Michael	Finkelstein; Abraham E.

4,650,016	Automatic weighing machine with minimized angle error and moment error	A weighing machine where a load generates proportional bending moments in a pair of parallel beams having strain-gauges. Resolution is greatly increased by shaping each end of the beams so that the points thereof where load and reactive forces are applied lie in a single horizontal plane. Thus, firstly, the separation between the load and reaction application points, at each beam end, which influences the weight-to-strain transfer function, is far less dependent on beam deflection, and, secondly, the error moments due to the inevitable horizontal forces are greatly minimized. Preferably, the application points form coupling edges in contact with a planar face of respective coupling members, thus assisting in maintaining said separation constant. When long beams are specified, their central portion is rigidized to avoid error magnification brought about by excessive beam deflection, and the strain-gauges are symmetrically connected at flexible portions near the ends thereof, to obtain a reading independent of load eccentricity.

4,626,387	Evaporative condenser with helical coils and method	A high efficiency evaporative condenser has spaced upper vapor supply and lower condensate collection headers coupled by a plurality of thin walled helical coils defining a plurality of helical flow paths. Maximum latent heat transfer is achieved by assuring rapid cleaning of liquid condensate from interior surfaces of the pipes cleaning the flow paths, continuous air-water wetting of the external surfaces and self-cleaning of the external surface of the coils defining the flow paths. Oil and condensate in the upper vapor supply header is provided with a flow path to the lower condensate collection header without lowering the heat transfer efficiency of the helical coils and vapor in the condensate header is vented to the vapor supply header to equalize pressure. A barometric leg is formed between the ends of the helical coil and condensate collection header to form a liquid column which exerts a negative pressure on the vapor in each helical path and prevent vapor lock. The headers are maintained in fixed relation so that the helical coils are constrained to expand radially for better self-cleaning of scale and encrustation. Air/water droplet contact with the coil is maximized due to the helical coil arrangement.	Leonard Oboler	Dodds; Diego E. F.

4,453,041	Method and apparatus for processing coded information received through a telephone line during the non-active intervals of a ringing period	A method and apparatus for screening unwanted calls by processing coded information received through a telephone line during the non-active intervals of a ringing period. Once the ringing loop has been established, a calling party "dials" a pre-established code, which may comprise one or more characters, during one or more of the non-active intervals of the ringing period. If the code is correct, the called party is alerted. The indication furnished to the called party may be an acoustic signal, a flashing light, an alphanumeric display, or any other suitable indication means. The apparatus, during the ringing period and after such coded information has been received thereby, decodes and compares the codes with pre-established codes stored in a memory device and, if it finds coincidence between the received code and one of the memorized pre-established codes, it will validate the code. If the code is validated, it will actuate the indicating means thus warning the called party that the calling party knows at least one of the codes. If the called party answers the call, the conversation loop will be closed and the parties may communicate. In one embodiment, the conventional loop a wrong code is sent, and after a very short interval it opens again. Other embodiments allow the reception of a second code sent by the calling party after the conversation loop closes, but still a first code will have been sent during at least one non-active interval of a ringing period. Yet another embodiment allows the second code to perform, at the receiving end, any useful electrically controllable operation.

4,421,399	Processing arrangement for photosensitive articles including a heater and a fluid control device	An arrangement for developing film has a developing chamber which is provided with an inlet and an outlet for the developer. The chamber is located above a first container having an open upper end and arranged to receive developer discharged through the outlet of the chamber. This container is located inside of or above a second container arranged to receive developer which overflows from the first container. The containers have respective outlets which merge into a single conduit leading to the developing chamber. A heating device surrounds the conduit or is accommodated in the first container and functions to heat the developer to a predetermined temperature required for development. A pump for circulating the developer is arranged in the conduit which leads to the developing chamber. The outlet of the second container is provided with a valve which is controlled by a thermal sensor. The total quantity of the developer greatly exceeds that which is actually required and the bulk of the developer is initially accommodated by the second container. Only sufficient developer to fill the developing chamber and to maintain circulation from the latter through the first container and the conduit back to the developing chamber is not received by the second container. The pump and the heating device are activated while the thermal sensor maintains the valve in its closed position. Thus, only the small portion of the developer which is not accommodated by the second container is circulated and subjected to the action of the heating device. Accordingly, this portion of the developer is heated to the developing temperature very rapidly thereby permitting the developing operation to begin shortly after the arrangement is activated. Once the developing temperature has been reached, the thermal sensor opens the valve to progressively mix the cool developer from the second container with the circulating hot developer. Such mixing may be enhanced by overflow from the first container to the second container.

4,387,272	Method and apparatus for controlling a subscriber phone system including at least one automatic phone-answering machine	A method and apparatus is provided for controlling a subscriber phone system including at least one automatic phone answering machine. When a calling party dials the phone number of a subscriber he wants to call, the apparatus will close the direct current loop, in response to which the calling party receives a ring-back signal. If he does not send a pre-established code after having received the ring-back signal, and after a predetermined period of time has elapsed, the phone line will be automatically connected to an automatic phone-answering machine. But if he dials a pre-established code after the closing of the direct current loop, the code will be displayed on a display device and at the same time an acoustic signal source will be activated, warning the called party that he is receiving a call from somebody who knows the pre-established code. Looking at the display device, the called party is able to know the code and may or may not want to attend the call. If he does attend the call, the automatic phone-answering machine will not be connected to the phone line; instead, the phone set of the subscriber will be, allowing him to answer the call in a normal way. If he does not attend the call or is not able to do so, for example because he is absent from the place, then, after a certain period of time has elapsed, the automatic phone-answering machine will be connected to the phone line.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	H04M 1/66 (20060101); H04M 1/665 (20060101); H04M 001/65 ()
