9,689,306	Method for supercritical diesel combustion	A method for supercritical diesel combustion combines fumigation and supercritical diesel fuel combustion to effect greater fuel efficiency and reduce exhaust gas pollutants from a compression ignition engine. The invention utilizes the fumigant method by combining two gases (DME and propane) which autoignite prior to the injection of the liquid diesel fuel. This pre-combustion of the fumigant gases combined with the engine's compression of the combustion chamber gases is managed to attain a supercritical combustion chamber environment into which the liquid diesel fuel is injected. This targeted supercritical combustion chamber environment causes the diesel fuel to become a supercritical fluid prior to combustion, resulting in significantly greater efficiency and negligible exhaust gas pollutants resulting from the combustion of the diesel fuel.

9,297,299	Method for superheated glycerin combustion	A method for superheated glycerin combustion (SGC) combines fumigation and SGC to effect greater fuel efficiency and reduce exhaust gas pollutants from a compression ignition engine such as a diesel engine. The invention utilizes the fumigant method by combining two gases (dimethyl ether and propane) which autoignite prior to the injection of the liquid glycerin water solution (GWS) fuel. This pre-combustion of the fumigant gases combined with the engine's compression of the combustion chamber gases is managed to attain a supercritical combustion chamber environment into which the liquid GWS fuel is injected. This targeted supercritical combustion chamber environment causes the GWS fuel to first vaporize the water which leaves the glycerin, prior to combustion, as highly dispersed monomers within the combustion chamber which autoignite similar to a "homogenous charge compression ignition" (HCCI) event resulting in significantly greater efficiency and negligible exhaust gas pollutants.

Additionally, human mammary cancer cells MCF-7 or MDAMB-231 were cultured in presence of the extract (or decoction), E, both or solvent and cell proliferation was evaluated. Various extracts or decoction displayed selective estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic action for some but not all parameters of estrogen stimulation in the uterus and inhibited growth of human mammary cells in culture or antagonized the estrogen-induced increase in their growth. Present results reveal, for the first time, a dissociation of responses to estrogen by phytoestrogens, suggesting its possible therapeutic application as estrogenic compounds not inducing cell proliferation and reveal the anticancerous effect of some of the extracts with possible therapeutic relevance. The dissociation of responses to estrogen additionally suggest therapeutic applications in estrogen-related diseases (for instance, premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis, etc.); the inhibition of eosinophil degranulation suggest an application in diseases related to eosinophils (hypereosinophilic syndrome, allergic and hypersensitivity diseases).

8,859,468	Hypermethylation biomarkers for detection of cervical cancer	Pap smears and HPV infection tests do not distinguish between lesions that will progress to an invasive carcinoma and those that will not. We aimed to identify epigenetic biomarkers for diagnosis and progression monitoring of premalignant lesions in cervical cancer. Hypermethylated genes were identified as potential biomarkers after validation by MSP, including GGTLA4 and ZNF516. The methylation frequency for these two genes was higher in tumor: GGTLA4 (100%) and ZNF516 (96%); than in normal samples: GGTLA4 (12%) and ZNF516 (16%). The methylation status of GGTLA4 showed a progression in methylation frequency from normal samples to invasive carcinoma. The immunohistochemical expression was lower in tumor for both: GGTLA4 (50.8%) and ZNF516 (66.2%); than in normal samples: GGTLA4 (71.2%) and ZNF516 (88.1%) (p<0.05). In conclusion, we identified methylation biomarkers for the molecular screening and characterization of cervical cancer.

8,808,214	Active ankle foot orthosis	An Active Ankle Foot Orthosis (AAFO) is provided where the impedance of an orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat ankle foot gait pathology, such as drop foot gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper (PD) control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop foot participants wearing the AAFO. It has been found that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot, allows greater powered plantar flexion, and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals.

8,757,390	Magnetic roller type separating device	Since Thomas Edison invented the magnetic roller separator for concentrating nickel mineral, drum and roller type separators have become the most common magnetic separators. These devices can be constructed with permanent magnets or with electromagnets, and the drum separator can operate with a dry or wet supply. However, still today, strongly magnetic material detaching from the roller is a problem that has been tried to be resolved by introducing the magnets inside the cylinders, in only one area thereof, in such a way that when the material is rotated on the cylinder and moves away from the magnetised area, it falls as a result of gravity. This system has a highly complex structure. The invention uses novel and powerful, very small neodymium magnets to cover the entire surface of the roller. In this way, a small device with a larger yield is produced in a very simple and economic manner. The particulate material to be separated is supplied over a plastic piece covering the magnetic roller that is in contact with same only over a fraction of the circumference, such that when the plastic piece moves away from the magnetic roller, the material falls as a result of gravity and is separated from the rest by means of a deflector.

The SAM module is also controlled by the system administrator, which allows dynamic and diversified codes to guarantee the security and veracity of the information being transmitted. The system, method and apparatus of the present invention are capable of being programmed regardless of the POS processor, and any sensitive data can be withheld entirely from the suppliers of the antenna and POS processor technology. Additionally, because each antenna has its own processor, it can work both on-line and off-line. The processor also has a non-volatile EEPROM memory for information storage, but stores the access codes and other sensitive data in volatile memory so that a power loss will erase the access codes from the processor memory, leaving them only in the storage module memory. All of these features restrict access to sensitive system information and secure that information from outside suppliers.

7,026,723	Air filtering chimney to clean pollution from a city and generate electric power	A solar chimney assembly including a chimney (3) is build using a mountain (11) as support. The chimney (3) receives air from a solar heat collector (1) that heats the air below it creating an updraft of air. The air goes up because of the difference in temperature and the difference of pressure between the base and the top of the chimney. This higher the difference of temperature and pressure, the faster the air will go up. An array of turbines (2) is driven by the air. The chimney (3) will be as high as the mountain (approximately 1,000 meters high or higher) and will go above the inversion layer or thermic ceiling (10). At the top of the chimney, a fine mist of electrically charged water (5), taken from a reservoir (4) is sprayed across the top of the tower, attracting pollution in the air like sulfur dioxide, soot and other particles. The water will fall because of gravity and will be collected in a second reservoir (6) and will be used to send it down the mountain through a pipe (7) to generate additional electric power with a turbine (8).

7,026,514	Compounds used to treat alcoholism	N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)cyclohexane-1,4-diamine, of formula (I), is a new compound that is prepared by hydrogenation with Raney nickel catalyst of N,N'-bis(2-cyanoethyl)-cyclohexane-1,4-diamine, the latter being prepared by reaction between 1,4-cyclohexanediamine and acrylonitrile. The oral administration to genetically alcoholic rats (from the strain UChB of the University of Chile) of the tetrametanesulfonate monohydrate of (I) causes a significant reduction in the alcohol consumption. The activity lasts for some time after the treatment period. Besides, there is a virtually null disulfiram-like adverse effect, what constitutes an advantage over the unpleasant use of some anti-alcoholism agents, such as calcium cyanamide or disulfiram itself. Therefore, the compounds of the invention are useful for the preparation of medicaments for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of alcoholism in mammals, including human beings ##STR00001##	April 11, 2006	Bilbeny Lojo; Norberto (Santiago de Chile, CL), Garcia Madrid; Hernan (Santiago de Chile, CL), Font Arellano; Maria Belen (Pamplona, ES)	C07C 211/36 (20060101); A61K 31/132 (20060101); A61P 25/32 (20060101); C07C 233/08 (20060101)

6,751,601	Method and a system for solving dynamic problems using the dynamical system architecture	The invention consists of a learning system (108) based on the Dynamical System Architecture (DSA). Every implementation of the DSA is composed of a dynamic system (112) and a static system (116). The dynamic system (112) generates an intermediate output (114), which together with an external input (100) is fed into the static system (116), which produces a generated output (106). Every time the dynamic system (112) is reset it produces the same trajectory: an intermediate output (114) that does not cross over itself during the temporal span of each of the events generated by a reference system (102) whose behavior has to be duplicated. The static system (116) can be anything that behaves like a trainable universal function approximator. Training uses the intermediate output (114), the external input (100), the observed output (104) produced by the reference system (102) whose behavior is going to be mimicked, and a self-organizing procedure that only modifies the parameters of the static system (116). Training of the dynamic system (112) is not necessary.	June 15, 2004	Zegers; Pablo (Santiago, RM, CL)	G06F 15/18 (20060101); G06F 015/18 ()
