9,778,540	Compact optical switch having only two waveguides and a resonant cavity to provide 60 degree folding	The present invention is based on a two-dimensional photonic crystal in which are inserted, in a controlled manner, defects that originate the waveguides and the resonant cavity that integrate the device. Its main function is to provide the control of the passage of an electromagnetic signal over a communications channel, blocking (state off) or allowing (state on) the passage of the signal. It also has the function of changing the propagation direction of an electromagnetic signal by an angle of 60 degrees, offering greater flexibility in the design of integrated optical systems. The operating principle of the device is associated with the excitation of dipole modes in the resonant cavity, which is based on a magneto-optical material. When the switch is under the influence of an external DC magnetic field H.sub.0, a rotating dipole mode excited in the cavity allows the passage of the input signal to the output (state on), whereas without the application of H.sub.0, a stationary dipole mode excited in the cavity, with the nodes aligned to the output waveguide, prevents the passage of the input signal to the output (state off).

9,778,496	Nonreciprocal three-way divider based on a magneto-optical resonator	The present invention is based on a two-dimensional photonic crystal in which defects are inserted in a controlled manner, has the main function of division of the power of an input signal, excited in one of its six waveguides, among other three waveguides (output ones), while keeping isolation of the input port by means of two other waveguides. The operating principle of the device is based on the alignment of a dipole mode excited in the resonant cavity, in such a way that the nodes of this mode are oriented in the direction of two waveguides, so that these waveguides are not excited. Due to this alignment, each of the three output waveguides receive about one third of the power of input signal. The orientation of dipole mode is controlled by the applied DC magnetic field and the physical and geometrical parameters of the resonator.

9,754,561	Managing memory regions to support sparse mappings	One embodiment of the present invention includes a memory management unit (MMU) that is configured to manage sparse mappings. The MMU processes requests to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses based on page table entries (PTEs) that indicate a sparse status. If the MMU determines that the PTE does not include a mapping from a virtual address to a physical address, then the MMU responds to the request based on the sparse status. If the sparse status is active, then the MMU determines the physical address based on whether the type of the request is a write operation and, subsequently, generates an acknowledgement of the request. By contrast, if the sparse status is not active, then the MMU generates a page fault. Advantageously, the disclosed embodiments enable the computer system to manage sparse mappings without incurring the performance degradation associated with both page faults and conventional software-based sparse mapping management.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	G06T 1/60 (20060101); G06F 12/0897 (20160101); G06F 12/10 (20160101); G06F 12/08 (20160101); G09G 5/39 (20060101); G06F 12/1027 (20160101)

9,719,224	Automotive vehicle skid recovery system	In a vehicle skid recovery system skid recovery can be accelerated when an automotive vehicle begins to skid as a result of ice accumulation on the road surface. The system can control operation of ice removers (e.g., blades or heaters), which are mounted within the wheel wells forward of the wheel, based on information received from the vehicle's outside temperature sensor and anti-lock braking system (ABS). When the temperature sensor indicates that the outside temperature is below a predetermined temperature and when the anti-lock braking system is activated as a result of detected skid, a controller activates the ice remover in one or more of the wheel wells and, thereby cause the ice remover to remove ice from the road surface forward of the corresponding wheel. Clearing the ice allows the vehicle's tires to gain traction on the road surface and, thereby stops the skid.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	E01H 5/06 (20060101); B60T 8/176 (20060101); E01H 5/10 (20060101); B60T 17/04 (20060101)

9,683,935	Method to measure surfactant in fluid	The invention is directed towards methods and compositions for identifying the presence of surfactants in water. The invention is quite superior over the prior art because it can form a colorful complex in half the time, avoid the need for difficult separation steps, use a safer solvent, and avoid the formation of messy foam. The invention involves adding to the water a cobalt thiocyanate reagent, pre-prepared from a cobalt salt and a thiocyanate salt, which forms a colorful complex with the surfactant. Chloroform is then added to the water. The cobalt reagent causes the virtually all of the surfactant to form a colored complex which rapidly migrates into the chloroform and prevents the surfactant from foaming. Once in the chloroform, a UV-vis spectrometer can easily and precisely identify the type and amount of surfactant that was in the water.

When combined the two form a gel coating that is resistant to erosion but is flexible while the pile or payload is still settling, jostling, being bumped, and otherwise moving around. This coating is especially effective for coal piles, iron ore piles, and also for piles within and/or being moved by open topped railroad cars. The coating's flexibility prevents the coating from becoming brittle and shattering. The coating has better performance than its ingredients do alone. As a result the invention can both prevent unwanted dust pollution as well as save its users money by avoiding loss of blown away material.	Ecolab USA Inc.

9,588,030	Dihedral sensor for evaluating tension, potential and activity of liquids	In the dihedral sensor system, two flat plates are secured to a dihedron so that the distance (L) between the edge and the meniscus and the spacing between the plates (a) on the meniscus will be a function of the dihedron tangent (.alpha.). Thus, for pure water the tension (.PSI.) is equal to the potential (T) and given by T=-2.sigma./[L tg(.alpha.)], wherein .sigma. is the water surface tension. In order to measure water tension in the soil, the system is coupled to porous elements, while the sensor edge is pressed directly against roots and other plant organs. Water potential, instead, is measured with the edge positioned at a few micrometers from the sample and the response takes place after the exchange of a few picoliters of water, when the condition of balance of temperature and water vapor is approached. Visually, with a sliding gauge, one measures water tensions between zero and 0.3 MPa, while with the aid of a microscope the reading extends up to 3.0 MPa. The water activity corresponding to water potentials lower than -3.0 MPa can also be measured by adding a known number of molecules of solutes suitable for the water kept in the sensor.

9,404,000	Flexographic printing process with wet on wet capability	The invention refers to a flexographic printing process with wet on wet capability based on controlled polymer or polymer segment precipitation that leads to gel formation of ink compounds by controlling the solubility parameter of the ink system. The mechanism to obtain a desirable wet on wet color trapping is the formation and/or presence of a gel in the applied ink film due to a controlled physicochemical mechanism of resin precipitation. This is accomplished either by controlling a change in the Hansen Solubility Parameter of the liquid in the ink through evaporation of some or all of a non-reactive and volatile solvent, or alternatively by use of a polymer comprised of two distinct and separate segments one of which is soluble in the monomer/oligomer mix and the other of which is not. The insoluble segments form a reversible gel that is broken to a liquid by shear in the application process, allowing application of a liquid ink, and is reestablished in the applied ink film in such a manner and with such strength as to allow overprinting in the wet on wet flexographic printing process.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	B41M 1/06 (20060101); C09D 11/107 (20140101); B41F 5/24 (20060101); B41F 23/04 (20060101); B41F 35/04 (20060101); B41M 1/04 (20060101); B41M 1/18 (20060101); B41F 31/02 (20060101); C09D 11/101 (20140101); C09D 11/02 (20140101)

9,396,515	Rendering using multiple render target sample masks	One embodiment sets forth a method for transforming 3-D images into 2-D rendered images using render target sample masks. A software application creates multiple render targets associated with a surface. For each render target, the software application also creates an associated render target sample mask configured to select one or more samples included in each pixel. Within the graphics pipeline, a pixel shader processes each pixel individually and outputs multiple render target-specific color values. For each render target, a ROP unit uses the associated render target sample mask to select covered samples included in the pixel. Subsequently, the ROP unit uses the render target-specific color value to update the selected samples in the render target, thereby achieving sample-level color granularity. Advantageously, by increasing the effective resolution using render target sample masks, the quality of the rendered image is improved without incurring the performance degradation associated with processing each sample individually.

9,231,417	Rechargeable electrical device	The charging current value in the first trickle charge after the rapid charge is differentiated from the charging current value in the second and subsequent trickle charge. Thus, for example, in the first trickle charge, charging can be performed with the charging current value required to simultaneously activate and charge an inactive battery. In the second and subsequent trickle charge, charging can be performed with the charging current value required to compensate for self-discharge of a rechargeable battery. By charging the battery with the charging current value required to compensate for self-discharge of the battery in the second and subsequent trickle charge, power consumption required to charge the battery can be reduced, compared to the case where the trickle charge is continued with a constant charging current value required to simultaneously activate and charge the inactive battery, as the conventional device.

In the other section, the coke is burned with air and the heating of the catalyst is controlled, for the adjustment of the appropriate amount of energy that the heated catalyst will convey to the section in which the endothermic reactions take place. The total ethene yield of the process according to the present invention is approximately 20% by weight in relation to the feedstock.

9,148,244	Method and apparatus for adaptive cancellation of external interference	In MU-MIMO scenarios, uncoordinated or external interference may be very significant. Such external interference can degrade the system performance as much as the internal interference. To address these problems, a desired signal subspace can be changed to avoid the external interference as much as possible. This technique can be applied in conjunction with systems that already cancel internal interference, such as Interference Alignment and Joint Processing. An original signal space may be broken down to desired and interference subspaces that are orthogonal to each other. The receiver can notify the transmitter of the boundary, and transmitter in turn can project the transmitted signal to fall into the desired subspace. The receiver can project the received signal into the desired subspace, which cancels everything not contained in the desired subspace.	Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson (publ)	Normando; Paulo G.

9,116,125	Method, apparatus and system for diagnosis of stress and disease in higher plants	The present invention relates to a method, apparatus and a system of fast diagnosis of stresses and diseases in higher plants. The proposed methodology is based on the hypothesis of that when a plant is in imbalance; there are changes in its metabolism that render an alteration of the chemical composition of its organs. This chemical alteration leads to a change in the physical properties, such as the fluorescence of the leaves. Due to the complexity of the material of the leaves, the present method proposes that the signal be treated with statistical methods and that the classification is made through softwares based on machine learning. As an example of the application of the invention, the results are shown for the Greening disease in citrus. Currently, Greening is the most severe citrus disease since there is no treatment available for it and due to its high dissemination rate and the fact that it affects all varieties of orange trees, being the diagnosis performed through visual inspection, which renders high subjectivity, high error percentage and the disease is only diagnosed after the expression of the symptoms (.about.8 months). During the asymptomatic phase, the infected tree is a source of dissemination of the disease. The present invention can perform the asymptomatic diagnosis of Greening disease from the leaf with a percentage of correct diagnosis higher than 80%.

9,090,702	Genes associated to sucrose content	Modern sugarcane cultivars are complex hybrids resulting from crosses among several species of the Saccharum genus. Traditional breeding methods have been extensively employed in different countries along the past decades to develop varieties with increased sucrose yield, and resistant to plagues and diseases. Conventional varietal improvement is, however, limited by the narrow pool of suitable markers. In this sense, molecular genetics is seen as a promising tool to assist in the process of molecular marker identification. The present invention concerns the identification of 348 genes associated with sucrose content in sugarcane plants. The genes were found to be differentially expressed when high sucrose and low sucrose plants and populations of plants were compared and/or when high and low sucrose internodes were compared. The expression data was obtained using cDNA microarray and quantitative PCR technologies. The genes identified can be used to identify, distinguish, characterize and/or develop plants with increased sucrose content. More preferably SEQ ID Nos: 1 to 203 should be useful as molecular markers. SEQ ID Nos: 204 to 228 are given as controls or examples of genes never associated with sucrose content. SEQ ID Nos. 1-203 and SEQ ID Nos. 229 to 373 can be targeted in the development of transgenic or non-transgenic varieties with increased sucrose content.	UNIVERSIDADE DE SAO PAULO-USP.

8,957,004	Aerated soap bars	The invention relates to aerated soap bars. Generally, it is difficult to get aerated soap bars with the right level of aeration, because high viscosity of the molten soap mass sometimes makes it difficult to aerate it to the desired extent. The size and movement of air bubbles also play important roles. Bars with larger air bubbles have lower mechanical strength. We have determined that use of acrylates or cellulose ethers in aerated soap bars lead to bars with acceptable rate of wear, mush and lower density. The soaps also have a higher and more uniform air incorporation and better air retention. Disclosed are aerated soap bars having density from 0.2 to 0.99 g/cm.sup.3, comprising: (i) 20 to 80 wt % soap; (ii) 2 to 40 wt % polyol; (iii) 5 to 50% water; and, (iv) 0.5 to 5 wt % electrolyte; wherein the bars comprise 0.1 to 5 wt % polymer selected from acrylates or cellulose ethers.

Notably, the node adjusts the uplink input covariances as needed to satisfy the individual transmit power constraints for the base stations, maps the uplink input covariances to corresponding downlink input covariances, and jointly precodes MU-MIMO transmissions sent over the downlink MU-MIMO channels based on those downlink input covariances.

8,798,946	Method and arrangement for a digital subscriber line	The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement based on two-port network (TPN) theory that allows analytically estimating the loop transfer function from open and short-circuited input impedance measurements, e.g. single ended line transmission (SELT) measurements, by utilizing the fact that the line under test (LUT) can be considered reciprocal and by assuming that the LUT is symmetric. Hence, by using the present invention and an estimation of the noise on the line, the attainable bit rate at the customer premises can be determined by means of SELT measurements at the CO. The transfer function of a telephone copper-loop is estimated regardless of its topology by impedance measurements from the CO side. Specifically, such estimation is carried out from the calculation of the transmission parameters of loop, which are expressed only in terms of open and short-circuited input impedance measurements at the CO when reciprocity and symmetry is assumed.		**Please see images for: ( Certificate of Correction ) **	G01R 25/00 (20060101); G01R 35/00 (20060101); H04M 1/24 (20060101); G01R 27/28 (20060101)

8,783,871	Near eye tool for refractive assessment	In exemplary implementations, this invention is a tool for subjective assessment of the visual acuity of a human eye. A microlens or pinhole array is placed over a high-resolution display. The eye is brought very near to the device. Patterns are displayed on the screen under some of the lenslets or pinholes. Using interactive software, a user causes the patterns that the eye sees to appear to be aligned. The software allows the user to move the apparent position of the patterns. This apparent motion is achieved by pre-warping the position and angle of the ray-bundles exiting the lenslet display. As the user aligns the apparent position of the patterns, the amount of pre-warping varies. The amount of pre-warping required in order for the user to see what appears to be a single, aligned pattern indicates the lens aberration of the eye.
