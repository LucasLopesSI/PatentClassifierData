Optimal design of maneuvers (such as fast seek and scanning) that rapidly change the output from one value to another, arise in flexible structure applications, including rapidly positioning the end-point of large-scale space manipulators, positioning of read/write heads of disk-drive servo systems, which are relatively medium-scale flexible structures, and nano-scale positioning and manipulation using relatively small-scale piezo actuators. Maintaining a position of an element constant outside of the transition time-interval is critical in many applications. For example, in disk-drive applications, read and write operations cannot be performed (before and after the output transition) if the output position is not precisely maintained at a desired track.","Dorf, R.C. and Bishop, R.

The lobes compress the bran as they rotate, while the lesser diameter of the rotor between lobes allows the bran to decompress, causing bran particles to rub together for detaching endosperm from the bran by friction forces. Bran particles also rub against the abrasive surfaces for scraping endosperm off the bran. Air flows through the milling chamber and carries the endosperm through the perforated screens, while the bran particles are discharged without passing through the screens.","International Search Report and Written Opinion for corresponding International Application No. PCT/US 12/63968 filed Nov. 7, 2012. cited by applicant."

Manifestations of Brugada syndrome can be corrected by delivering endocardial electrical stimulation coincident to the activation wave front propagated from the atrioventricular (AV) node. By performing the start of the activation of the HIS bundle or para-Hisian region early enough, electrical stimulation can be delivered fast enough to compensate for the conduction problems that start in those region, such that the activation wave front, as stimulated, transitions from the AV node to the His bundle in a normal, albeit electrically-supplemented, fashion. This stimulation not only helps resolve the conditions that trigger Brugada syndrome, but also resolves the asynchrony of the contraction of the heart.","Kathy L Lee et al., Prevention of Ventricular Fibrillation by Pacing in a Man with Brugada Syndrome, J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol., vol. 11, pp. 935-937, (Aug. 2000). cited by applicant .

"Downhole waterflood regulator","E21B 43/123 (20130101)","A downhole waterflood regulator installs in a side pocket mandrel to regulate fluid flow in a waterflood completion. The regulator has an internal piston and can have a check dart. The piston and check dart regulate fluid flow within the regulator's housing. Packings on the regulator's housing packoff the mandrel's ports that communicate with a surrounding annulus. When initially installed in the mandrel, a blanking plug on the regulator's latch prevents fluid flow through the regulator so that the regulator acts as a dummy valve and allows operators to set and test packers or perform other operations. To begin the waterflood operation, operators use a slickline to remove the blanking plug disposed in the latch. With the plug removed, fluid communicated from the tubing string can pass through the ported latch and into the regulator where the piston and check dart regulate the fluid flow out to the annulus.","Baker Oil Tools; Waterflood Flow Regulators; Product Information Brochure; Jul. 2004. cited by other .

"Incision and closure surgical device","A61B 17/085 (20130101); A61B 2017/088 (20130101)","Incision and closure surgical device designed to assist in operative surgery as a means of effecting and repairing skin wounds. A slide fastener is fitted to a self-adhesive sheet that is attached to the skin surface. The slider of the slide fastener contains a contact electrode for electrocoagulation fitted with a cutting edge. As the slide fastener is opened, the slider simultaneously effects the incision by means of the cutting edge of the electrode, severing both the flexible sheet and the skin beneath. For closing the incision, the stringer tapes of the slide fastener interlock by the action of the slider, thereby bringing both the edges of the flexible sheet and the wound beneath into apposition. As the slider is drawn forwards closing the stringer tapes, electrical energy is applied by the electrode at the union site of the wound edges, which have previously been brought into apposition by the mechanical action of the slide fastener, thus ensuring that the edges become adhered in full depth as a result of electrical coagulation.","Onuminya Je, Alufohai E, Onuminya DS.

Under ordinary conditions, the width of the synchronization range decreases when the oscillation amplitude grows, which constrains synchronized motion of micro- and nano-mechanical resonators to narrow frequency and amplitude bounds. The present invention shows that nonlinearity in the oscillator can be exploited to manifest a regime where the synchronization range increases with an increasing oscillation amplitude. The present invention shows that nonlinearities in specific configurations of oscillator systems, as described herein, are the key determinants of the effect. The present invention presents a new configuration and operation regime that enhances the synchronization of micro- and nano-mechanical oscillators by capitalizing on their intrinsic nonlinear dynamics.","Antonio, et al., Nonlinearity-Induced Synchronization Enhancement in Micromechanical Oscillators, Physical Review Letters, PRL 114, 034103, Jan. 23, 2015, 5 pages. cited by applicant .

These coatings are amorphous in the as-deposited state, but upon thermal treatments, chromium nanocrystallization, as well as precipitation of carbides and phosphides occurs. Incorporation of phosphorous strongly influences the structural evolution and mechanical properties. Electroplated Cr--C alloy coatings exhibit significant increases in hardness and strength, when exposed to temperatures up to about 600.degree. C., owing to the evolution of their nanostructure. This evolution can be shifted to higher temperatures (approaching 850.degree. C.), through a ternary addition of phosphorous. The resulting Cr--C--P coatings may be suitable for applications at higher service temperatures, where more conventional Cr-based coatings soften rapidly.","International Preliminary Report on Patentability mailed May 22, 2009, PCT/US2007/000146. cited by other .

Block-based LMS (BLMS) algorithm is one of the many efficient adaptive equalization algorithms used to (i) increase convergence speed and (ii) reduce implementation complexity. Since the computation of the equalizer output and the gradient of the error are obtained using a linear convolution, BLMS can be efficiently implemented in the frequency domain with the constrained frequency-domain BLMS (FBLMS) adaptive algorithm. The present invention introduces a novel reduced complexity constrained FBLMS algorithm. This new approach replaces the two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) stages required to evaluate the DFT of the gradient error, by a simple frequency domain filtering. Implementation complexity can be drastically reduced in comparison to the standard constrained FBLMS. Furthermore, the new approach achieves better performance than that obtained with the unconstrained FBLMS in ultra-high speed coherent optical receivers.","Un-Ku Moon et al., Timing Recovery in CMOS using Nonlinear Spectral-line Method, IEEE 1996 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 1996, pp. 13-16, IEEE. cited by applicant .

The receiver skew is compensated by programming the phase of the sampling clocks for the different channels. Furthermore, during real-time operation of the receiver, channel diagnostics is performed to automatically estimate differential group delay and/or other channel characteristics based on the equalizer coefficients using a frequency averaging or polarization averaging approach. Framer information can furthermore be utilized to estimate differential group delay that is an integer multiple of the symbol rate. Additionally, a DSP reset may be performed when substantial signal degradation is detected based on the channel diagnostics information.","El-Chammas, M. et al., A 12-Gs/s 81-mW 5-bit Time-Interleaved Flash ADC With Background Timing Skew Calibration"

The center of gravity (CG) of the filter coefficients can be used to evaluate a proper convergence of a time-domain adaptive equalizer. However, the computation of CG in a dual-polarization optical coherent receiver is difficult when a frequency domain (FD) adaptive equalizer is adopted. In this case, the implementation of several inverse fast-Fourier transform (IFFT) stages is required to back time domain impulse response. Here, examples of the present invention estimate CG directly from the FD equalizer taps and compensate for an error of convergence based off of the estimated CG. This estimation method and associated device architecture is able to achieve an excellent tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.","Un-Ku Moon et al., Timing Recovery in CMOS using Nonlinear Spectral-line Method, IEEE 1996 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 1996, pp. 13-16, IEEE. cited by applicant .

"CRYPTOGRAPHIC METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING DIGITAL CERTIFICATES","H04L 9/32 20060101 H04L009/32; H04L 9/30 20060101 H04L009/30","Pseudonym digital certificates (160p) are generated for devices (110/150) by a Pseudonym Certificate Authority (PCA), which communicates with devices via another entity--registration authority (RA)--so that the PCA and RA cannot associate certificates with devices. Each certificate is associated with a public signature key, and with a public encryption key used by PCA to encrypt the certificate to hide it from the RA. Both keys are derived by PCA from a single key. For example, the signature key can be derived from the public encryption key rather than generated independently. However, high security is obtained even when the PCA does not sign the encrypted certificate. Reduced bandwidth and computational costs are obtained as a result. Other embodiments are also provided.","US. Appl. No. 62/561,667, filed Sep. 21, 2017. cited by applicant . U.S. Appl. No. 16/136,621, filed Sep. 20, 2018. cited by applicant . W. Whyte, A.

The injection rate of injection fluid pumped into a formation can be controlled to alternate between monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing during the enhanced recovery operation. Injection rates can be monotonically increased to a maximum level (e.g., as defined by physical constraints of the system) and then monotonically decreased to a lower level, allowing the injection rates to be monotonically increased again. While injection rates are monotonically increasing, viscous fingering between the injection fluid and hydrocarbons can be minimized while the hydrocarbons in the formation are displaced. While injection rates are monotonically decreasing, creation of new viscous fingers can be minimized while the injection rates are decreased to levels suitable for the monotonic increasing phase of a subsequent monotonic cycle.","Dias et al., Minimization of Viscous Fluid Fingering: A Variational Scheme for Optimal Flow Rates, Phys Rev Lett., vol. 109, 2012, pp. 1-5. cited by applicant .

Using the two-dimensional conducting materials, once a fluid sample is applied into the channel, highly localized modulated electric field distributions are generated inside the channel and the fluid sample. This generated field causes the inducing of dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces. These DEP forces are the same or greater than DEP forces that would result using metallic electrodes because of the sharp edges enabled by the two-dimension geometry of the two-dimensional conducting materials. Because of the induced forces, micro/nano-particles in the fluid sample are separated into particles that respond to a negative DEP force and particles that respond to a positive DEP. Microfluidic chips with microfluidic channels can be made using standard semiconductor manufacturing technology.","S K. Amen, et al.

The combinator includes a number of series-connected combinator stages and the differentiator includes a number of series-connected differentiator stages. The CCD filter functions similarly to an interpolator filter, filtering and up-sampling the baseband signal out of the baseband. In one embodiment, the up-sampling factor is twice the number of channels (2N). The disclosed DUC does not require complex mixers or oscillators. Also, the low-pass filter of the DUC does not require a narrow transition band, so the number of coefficients for the low-pass filter is relatively low.","Cui, X., et al., Design and Implementation of Digital Up Converter for Homenet; 2005 IEEE Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits; DOI: 10.1109/EDSSC.2005.1635382; Date of Conference: Dec. 19-21, 2005. cited by applicant .

C. to 500.degree. C.) and a system for treating waste gases produced by thermal decomposition of composite material matrixes which employs a secondary reactor (201), containing within the same a thermal plasma arc (211). The main characteristic of the process, within the scope of the carbon fiber recycling, is the possibility of maintaining the fabric web, obtaining fabrics made of pure carbon fiber, without a significant amount of residues and preserving their structural characteristics. The thermal plasma allows managing high temperatures (2,000.degree. C. to 15,000.degree. C.) in a controlled atmosphere, which allows the dissociation of long chains of molecules into ions that are recombined to produce combustible gases and other acid or alkaline gases that are easily neutralized and retained in gas cleaning systems.","Pimenta et al; Recycling carbon fibre reinforced polymers for structural applications: Technology review and market outlook, Waste Management 31 (2011) 378-392. cited by applicant."

"SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FRAME BUFFER DECOMPRESSION AND/OR COMPRESSION","345/424","A system and method for decompressing compressed data (e.g., in a frame buffer) and optionally recompressing the data. The method includes determining a portion of an image to be accessed from a memory and sending a conditional read corresponding to the portion of the image. In response to the conditional read, an indicator operable to indicate that the portion of the image is uncompressed may be received. If the portion of the image is compressed, in response to the conditional read, compressed data corresponding to the portion of the image is received. In response to receiving the compressed data, the compressed data is uncompressed into uncompressed data. The uncompressed data may then be written to the memory corresponding to the portion of the image. The uncompressed data may then be in-place compressed for or during subsequent processing.","John M.

A bulk fine timing measurement (BFTM) allocation message is generated by a scheduling mobile computing device that identifies other mobile computing devices in the area. The BFTM allocation message generated by the scheduling mobile computing device indicates a time of delivery (TOD), a scheduling order for the identified mobile computing devices, and a contention-free period for the mobile computing devices to transmit the timing measurement messages. The mobile computing devices generate BFTM timing message, which include times of arrival (TOAs) or propagation timing estimates, associated with message from other devices. The scheduling order indicates a sequence of transmissions (e.g., a forward and reverse sequence) in which the responding mobile computing devices are to transmit the BFTM timing messages, which are used in location-detection services.","Ji, Lin., Increasing Accuracy of Location Determination: Exploiting Phase Change Reconstruction and Timing Measurements, In Master Thesis, Retrieved on: Jun. 29, 2015, 58 pages. cited by applicant .

"HANDLING POST-Z COVERAGE DATA IN RASTER OPERATIONS","345/419","Techniques are disclosed for storing post-z coverage data in a render target. A color raster operations (CROP) unit receives a coverage mask associated with a portion of a graphics primitive, where the graphics primitive intersects a pixel that includes a multiple samples, and the portion covers at least one sample. The CROP unit stores the coverage mask in a data field in the render target at a location associated with the pixel. One advantage of the disclosed techniques is that the GPU computes color and other pixel information only for visible fragments as determined by post-z coverage data. The GPU does not compute color and other pixel information for obscured fragments, thereby reducing overall power consumption and improving overall render performance.","David Blythe, The Direct3D 10 System, ACM, 2006. cited by examiner .

"KERNEL CONVOLUTION FOR STENCIL COMPUTATION OPTIMIZATION","G06F 17/15 20060101 G06F017/15","Data processing techniques are provided to increase a computational speed of iterative computations that are performed over a domain of data points, such as stencil computations. For example, a method includes loading a set of domain data points into a cache memory; obtaining an iteration count T, and a base stencil operator having a first set of coefficients; generating a convolved stencil operator having a second set of coefficients, wherein the convolved stencil operator is generated by convolving the base stencil operator with itself at least one time; and iteratively processing the set of domain data points in the cache memory using the convolved stencil operator no more than T/2 iterations to obtain final processing results. The final processing results are similar to processing results that would be obtained by iteratively processing the set of domain data points using the base stencil operator for the iteration count T.","Wikipedia, Convolution, Oct. 2015, 14 pages. cited by applicant .

A design candidate with a cost function closest to the target cost function is chosen and modified in an optimization routine to provide a modified design candidate having modified device design parameters. The cost function for the modified initial design candidate is computed, and when the modified design candidate has a computed cost function that meets the target cost function, optimized device design parameters of an optimized device design are obtained. Additional optimization iterations may be performed as needed to arrive at an optimized device design. A micro-fluidic device based on the optimized device design is manufactured.","Junping Geng et al., The Study on the Antenna Optimization, PIERS Proceedings, Xi'an, China, Mar. 22-26, 2010, pp. 706-709. cited by applicant .

Heteroscedastic data is compressed by obtaining the heteroscedastic data; applying the heteroscedastic data to an ARIMA-GARCH model; determining residuals between the obtained heteroscedastic data and the ARIMA-GARCH model; and compressing parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model and the residuals using entropy encoding, such as an arithmetic encoding, to generate compressed residual data. Parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model are adapted to fit the obtained heteroscedastic data. The compressed residual data is decompressed by performing an entropy decoding and obtaining the parameters of the ARIMA-GARCH model and the residuals. The ARIMA-GARCH model predicts heteroscedastic data values and then the decompressed residuals are added.","Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31 (3): 307-327. cited by applicant .

When combined the two form a gel coating that is resistant to erosion but is flexible while the pile or payload is still settling, jostling, being bumped, and otherwise moving around. This coating is especially effective for coal piles, iron ore piles, and also for piles within and/or being moved by open topped railroad cars. The coating's flexibility prevents the coating from becoming brittle and shattering. The coating has better performance than its ingredients do alone.

A stored list of population members, e.g., hydrocarbon reservoirs, characteristics and analogous members is partitioned into lists for each member. A weighting system automatically uses the partitions to determine a weight set (w*) for population member characteristic and a similarity function. The weighting system may include an objective model that iteratively, blindly identifies analogous members for each population member until the identified analogous members match the listed analogous members. An analogous member selector uses the weights set (w*) and similarity function to automatically select analogous listed members for each new population member.","Hosein Hashemi; Logical considerations in applying pattern recognition techniques on seismic data: Precise ruling, realistic solutions; Apr. 2010; Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran; CSEG Recorder pp. 47-49. cited by examiner .

"PARAVIRTUALIZED MIGRATION COUNTER FOR MIGRATING A VIRTUAL CPU TO A DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CPU","G06F 9/455 20060101 G06F009/455","An application associated with a virtual processor running on a physical processor reads a first value of a counter and a second value of the counter. The counter is indicative of a migration status of the virtual processor with respect to the physical processor. Responsive to determining that the first value of the counter does not equal the second value of the counter, the application ascertains whether a value of a hardware parameter associated with the physical processor has changed during a time interval. The migration status indicates a count of the number of times the virtual processor has migrated a first physical processor to a second physical processor. The application determines the validity of a value of a performance monitoring unit derived from the hardware parameter in view of the application ascertaining whether the value of the hardware parameter has changed during the time interval.","Benevenuto, Fabricio et al., A Quantitavive Analysis of the Xen Virtualization Overhead, Computer Science Department, Federal Univeristy of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 9 Pages http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/.about.fabricio/download/ccc07.pdf (Last accessed Feb. 5, 2016). cited by applicant .

"SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA USING A SYMBOLOGY","235/375","Methods and systems for sending personal data using a symbology are disclosed. An entity computing device transmits a request to a remote computing device to define a transaction code and an associated symbology used to request personal data, which are returned to the requesting entity computing device. The entity displays the symbology in a manner accessible by a user. When a user scans the symbology using a user electronic device, the user electronic device determines the transaction code based on the symbology and transmits the transaction code to the remote computing device. The remote computing device identifies the user of the user electronic device and the personal data to transmit for the user with the user electronic device and transmits the personal data to the entity computing device, which uses the personal data to populate an online form or other construct.","Tesco Homplus Subway Virtual Store, Legendado PT, BR, YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WBw1AmduSo. cited by applicant."

"Measuring The Phase Of Received Signals","702/89","The present disclosure relates to a method to determine the phase of a signal when transmitter and receiver circuits use separate clocks. A discrepancy between the separate clocks is determined, as is a correction factor between the separate clocks. The phase is determined using a measured time of arrival of the signal, the determined discrepancy, and the determined correction factor. A drift factor and an expected start time of a pulse sequence may be used to determine the discrepancy. A start time of a pulse within the pulse sequence is determined and used to determine the correction factor. The method works by either absolute synchronization of the separate clocks, or by making the measurements independent of clock synchronization.","International Search Report and the Written Opinion for International Application No. PCT/US2010/032606 dated Nov. 30, 2010. cited by applicant."

"IDENTIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO CONTAIN EMBEDDED MALWARE","726/24","The present invention provides a method for determining the likelihood that an electronic document contains embedded malware. After parsing or sequencing an electronic document, the metadata structures that make up the document are analyzed. A number of pre-established rules are then applied with respect to certain metadata structures that are indicative of embedded malware. The application of these rules results in the generation of a score for the electronic document being tested for embedded malware. The score is then compared to a threshold value, where the threshold value was previously generated based on a statistical model relating to electronic documents having the same format as the document being tested. The result of the comparison can then be used to determine whether the document being tested is or is not likely to contain embedded malware.","Kittilsen, Jarle. Detecting malicious PDF documents.

"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ADAPTIVE CANCELLATION OF EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE","370/329","In MU-MIMO scenarios, uncoordinated or external interference may be very significant. Such external interference can degrade the system performance as much as the internal interference. To address these problems, a desired signal subspace can be changed to avoid the external interference as much as possible. This technique can be applied in conjunction with systems that already cancel internal interference, such as Interference Alignment and Joint Processing. An original signal space may be broken down to desired and interference subspaces that are orthogonal to each other. The receiver can notify the transmitter of the boundary, and transmitter in turn can project the transmitted signal to fall into the desired subspace. The receiver can project the received signal into the desired subspace, which cancels everything not contained in the desired subspace.","Dictionary.com Definition of the word Analyzer retrieved Apr. 2, 2015. cited by examiner .

The system can control operation of ice removers (e.g., blades or heaters), which are mounted within the wheel wells forward of the wheel, based on information received from the vehicle's outside temperature sensor and anti-lock braking system (ABS). When the temperature sensor indicates that the outside temperature is below a predetermined temperature and when the anti-lock braking system is activated as a result of detected skid, a controller activates the ice remover in one or more of the wheel wells and, thereby cause the ice remover to remove ice from the road surface forward of the corresponding wheel. Clearing the ice allows the vehicle's tires to gain traction on the road surface and, thereby stops the skid.","Nixon, W., The Potential of Friction as a Tool for Winter Maintenance, IIHR Technical Report No. 392, Feb. 1998, 34 pages. cited by applicant . http://insta-chain.com, 2012. cited by applicant."

"SYSTEM, METHOD AND PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR COST-AWARE SELECTION OF STORED VIRTUAL MACHINE IMAGES FOR SUBSEQUENT USE","718/1","A system, method and computer program product for allocating shared resources. Upon receiving requests for resources, the cost of bundling software in a virtual machine (VM) image is automatically generated. Software is selected by the cost for each bundle according to the time required to install it where required, offset by the time to uninstall it where not required. A number of VM images having the highest software bundle value (i.e., highest cost bundled) is selected and stored, e.g., in a machine image store. With subsequent requests for resources, VMs may be instantiated from one or more stored VM images and, further, stored images may be updated selectively updated with new images.","M Stillwell, et al., Resource allocation algorithms for virtualized service hosting platforms, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, vol. 70, No. 9, pp. 962-974, Sep. 2010. cited by applicant .

"REMOTE CONTROL FOR BRAKING SYSTEM OF PROGRESSIVE CAVITY PUMP","188/110 ; 188/158","A brake actuator has a motor that provides input rotation in first and second directions. A reducer couples to the motor and reduces the input rotation into an output rotation to be applied to a brake screw of a progressive cavity pump drive. A sensor measures rotational speed of the drive shaft. In manual operation, an operator can view an indication of the rotational speed and can manually operate the motor accordingly to control rotation of the shaft. In automated operation, a controller automatically controls the motor based on the rotational speed measured by the sensor. The controller can also use a torque sensor to detect the torque applied to the brake screw, a displacement sensor to detect displacement of the brake screw, and/or a current sensor to detect the current consumption of the motor.","Canadian IPO, Office Action in counterpart Canadian Appl.

"System and Method for Producing Look-Ahead Profile Measurements in a Drilling Operation","702/7 ; 702/11; 702/9","A method and system for producing look-ahead profiles measurements includes positioning an energy transmitter, such as a transmitting antenna, proximate to a borehole assembly tool. One or more energy receivers, such as receiving antennas, are positioned along a length of the borehole assembly. Next, energy is transmitted to produce look-ahead scans relative to the borehole assembly tool. Look-ahead graph data with an x-axis being a function of a time relative to the position of the borehole assembly tool is generated. The look-ahead graph is produced and displayed on a display device. The look-ahead graph may track estimated formation values based on earth models. The estimated formation values are displayed below a tool position history line that is part of the look-ahead graph. The estimated formation values in the look-ahead graph may be based on inversions of resistivity data from the look-ahead scans.","International Search Report and Written Opinion for International Application No. PCT/US2012/067696 dated Feb. 27, 2013. cited by applicant."

"CODE COVERAGE CIRCUITRY","365/149 ; 365/189.011","A circuit includes a memory (130) coupled to an analog line coverage circuit (104). The analog line coverage circuit includes a plurality of buffers (151-154) in which each buffer is coupled to one memory location of the memory, a plurality of bin cells (161-164) in which each bin cell is coupled to a buffer, a multiplexer (170), each input terminal of which is coupled to a bin cell, and an analog-to-digital converter (180) coupled to the multiplexer and to an output terminal of the analog line coverage circuit. The analog line coverage circuit stores an analog voltage that is representative of a number of occasions that a memory location is accessed, and outputs a signal indicative thereof. A processor (102) is coupled to the memory and to the analog line coverage circuit, and the processor enables the analog line coverage circuit when the processor is in a debug mode.","Rajagopal Vijayaraghavan, et al., Design for MOSIS Educational Program (Research), EE Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, http://www-ece.engr.utk.edu/Analog.sub.--Counter.sub.--Report.pdf. cited by applicant."
"COLD START ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEMS AND METHODS","701/103","A control system includes a starter control module, a mode setting module, a throttle control module, and a fuel control module. The starter control module initiates cranking of a spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) engine in response to user actuation of an ignition switch. The mode setting module sets a mode of operation to a coldstart mode when an engine coolant temperature is less than a predetermined temperature during the cranking. The throttle control module allows a throttle valve to be biased to a predetermined open position when the SIDI engine is off and, in response to the setting of the mode to the coldstart mode, selectively closes the throttle valve relative to the predetermined open position during the cranking. The fuel control module, in response to the setting of the mode to the coldstart mode, disables direct injection of fuel for a first combustion event during the cranking.","Knock Suppression Calculations in Highly Turbocharged Gasoline/Ethanol Engines Using Direct Ethanol Injection; L.

"Managing a Contact Center Based on the Devices Available for Use by an Agent","379/265.13","In a contact center, agents are assigned to support customers using various media, such as audio, video, and/or text communications. The various media types have a related application. The mediums that an agent can support are determined. In addition, an agent has devices that are available for use by the agent. For example, the agent may have a cellular telephone and a tablet device available for use. The related application(s) are associated with the devices available for use by the agent based on a capability of at least one device. This is done in relation to the medium(s) supported by the agent. For example, an audio application can be associated with a cellular telephone and a text application can be associated with a tablet device. As the devices or mediums supported by the agent changes, the system can re-associate the related application(s) based on the new configuration.","Nortel Networks, Nortel Communication Server 1000: CS 1000 to MCS 5100 Converged Desktop Type 2 Configuration Guide, Document No. 553-3001-521, Document Release 3.00, Oct. 2006, 132 pages, produced in Canada. cited by applicant .

The back-to-back user agent server receives a SIP invite from a caller and converts the SIP invite to an HTTP request, wherein headers from the SIP invite are preserved in the HTTP request. The server transmits the HTTP request to a user agent client via a wide area network connection and receives, from the user agent client, an HTTP response to the HTTP request. The server converts the HTTP response to a SIP response, and transmits the SIP response to the caller, wherein the SIP response contains instructions for establishing SIP communications between the caller and a callee via a network.","Translation routing, Circo Support Community, Discussions, Feb. 26, 2007, Retrieved from https://supportforums.cisco.com/message/1035916?tstart=0. cited by applicant .

"Bridging Hanger and Seal Running Tool","166/348","A running tool sets and pressure tests a bridging hanger and a packoff in a single trip. The running tool has a stem, an inner body, and a piston. The inner body is connected to the stem so that rotation of the stem relative to the inner body will cause the stem to move longitudinally. The piston is connected to the stem so that the stem and piston rotate and move longitudinally in unison. A piston engagement element is housed in the inner body and is adapted to engage the piston when the bridging hanger is set to prevent premature setting of the packoff. The piston engagement element can be disengaged once the bridging hanger is set, thereby allowing the piston to set the packoff.","US. Appl. No. 12/416,780, filed Apr. 1, 2009. cited by other .
